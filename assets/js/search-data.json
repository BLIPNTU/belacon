This can stand for a whole line or it can be inserted for a word of phrase. Remember, don’t put punctuation after ### in your transcript. Do not transcribe only part of a word as ###. For example, you should never transcribe ###ing or ###ed. After you are done transcribing the utterances in the Baby Utterance and Chunk tier, you need to add the baby noise category in the Baby (Language) tier. Idiosyncratic words: Sometimes children invent words that have nothing to do with the standard, adult version of the word. For example, a child might say “neenee” meaning “guitar” or “Amwes” meaning “Nemo”. If the idiosyncratic word has a clearly identifiable meaning that occurs in at least one obvious context, transcribe the word as it sounds, followed by the @ symbol, and indicate the word and its meaning after the @. e.g., neenee@guitar . Where the baby is mimicking an adult speaking, note it in the “Baby (Utterance)” tier as &lt;mimicking&gt; . ",

    "content": "In order to understand how to use a Controlled Vocabulary, you need to first understand what a Type is. A type dictates what list of controlled vocabulary is used with a tier. You can create a ‘type’ so that more than one tier can share controlled vocabulary, or create multiple types, so that different tiers can have different controlled vocabulary. For example, say you are annotating an audio clip where a participant is recording a word list. You want to have one tier, called “Segment”, where you break down the word into individual phonemes (smallest unit of sound e.g., the word ‘cat’ has three phonemes /k/, /a/, and /t/). You also want another tier, called “Word”, for annotating the whole word. On the “Segment” tier, there are too many different consonants, vowels, and diacritics to have a controlled vocabulary so you can give it a type “S”. Type “S” is not associated with a controlled vocabulary so you can type in whatever text you want into each cell while annotating. On the “Word” tier, there are a limited number of words since the participant is reading from a word list so you can give it a type “W”. Type “W” is associated with a controlled vocabulary so you can choose the word you want to make the annotation process quicker. This example will walk you through the process of assigning a tier’s type, and assigning a controlled vocabulary to its own corresponding tier type. This is a new file. The default tier, as shown is named default. Firstly we go to “Edit” -&gt; “Edit Controlled Vocabulary” to add a Controlled Vocabulary, as such. Then, you to go “Type” and “Add New Tier Type” to establish which tier corresponds with which Controlled Vocabulary, as follows. When the tier types have been set up, the screen will look like this: . Then you go to “Tier” to Change the attributes of the existing “default” tier. Change the name of the Tier to “Tier 1”. Change the Type of the Tier from “default-lt” to “New Tier” . Click “Change”. Tier 1 can now access the Controlled Vocabulary “Test”. As seen in the following example. Back to table of contents . ",

A tier is visual space where you section portions of the audio to then be labeled. You can have multiple tiers, meaning you can section the same portion of audio in several different ways. The picture below shows two empty tiers. Back to table of contents . 1.2 What is a cell? . A cell is a section of a tier for which the annotator has marked a beginning and an end that can be labelled (e.g., the annotator marks the beginning of the cell labeled “bat” at the release of the /b/ in “bat” and the end of cell at end of /t/). Depending on the type of transcription you are doing, you might want to create cells for each word, or for whole phrases, or for some other feature of interest. The picture below shows an empty cell on tier 1 that is ready to be annotated. Back to table of contents . 1.3 What is an annotation? . When you have created a cell inside a tier and labeled it, this is called an annotation. In the picture below, there are two tiers containing annotations. Tier 2 contains an annotation of the utterance as a whole, while Tier 1 contains annotations of the utterance sub-divided into individual words. Back to table of contents . 1.4 Different Modes . You can switch between modes by going to “Options” and selecting which mode you would like to go to, as shown in the picture below. There are different modes for creating annotations. The main modes are ‘annotation mode’, ‘segmentation mode’, and ‘transcription mode’. Back to table of contents . 1.4.1 Segmentation Mode . Segmentation mode is the mode you use to segment the audio into cells by placing boundaries on a tier. When you use this mode, you can come back afterwards, and fill in which word is which later. The photo below shows a screen on segmentation mode, with the “Baby” tier selected to have sections of it segmented. Back to table of contents . 1.4.2 Annotation Mode . Annotation mode is the default mode that is active when you open a file in ELAN. This mode is what you use to define the contents of each cell. Once you have created cells using segmentation mode (as in section 1.4.1), you can transcribe them in annotation mode by double-clicking on the cells and either typing in text or choosing from a drop-down menu of words from a controlled vocabulary. Back to table of contents . 1.4.3 Transcription Mode . Transcription mode is another mode in which you can transcribe each cell formed in segmentation mode by either typing in text for each cell or choosing text from a controlled vocabulary. Transcription is faster in this mode as you can move from one cell to the next automatically without having to double-click each new cell. Back to table of contents . ",

    "content": ". | Background | Tier type stereotypes | . 2.1 Background . Tiers in ELAN can be independent or be dependent on/refer to other tiers. Independent tiers consist of annotations linked to the time axis. Dependent tiers contain annotations linked to annotations on a primary/parent tier, and can optionally be linked to the time axis. These dependent tiers are in hierarchical primary-secondary (parent-child) relationships. The image below is an example of a tier hierarchy. “Mother” is the primary tier with six secondary tiers (Language, Chunk, Words, Morpheme, POS, and Translation). Note: ELAN formally refers to the dependent tiers as “parent” and “child” tiers. This may be a bit confusing in our context as we transcribe recorded discourse from actual families. As such, the parent tier will henceforth be referred to as “primary”, and the child tier will be “secondary”. Changes made to the primary tier, such as deleting the tier or adjusting the time interval, will affect the secondary tier. The primary tier’s time interval cannot be adjusted independently. Moreover, deleting the secondary tier will not affect the primary tier. Back to table of contents . 2.2 Tier type stereotypes . Each tier is assigned a type stereotype (constraints enforced on the tier). For example, whether or not the annotations in a primary tier will be subdivided in the secondary tier and time-aligned. The choice of which stereotype is used depends on the objectives and purpose of a transcription task. The table below is a summary of ELAN tier type stereotypes. | Stereotype Name | Dependent (i.e., must have primary tier) | Time-aligned | Sub-divided annotations | Description | Example | . | None | No | Yes | No | Cannot have a primary tier. Non-overlapping annotations on an independent tier linked to the time axis | | . | Time Subdivision | Yes | Yes, with no time gaps | Yes | Sub-divided annotations from the primary tier that are linked to the primary’s time interval. No time gaps between sub-divided annotation units. | | . | Included in | Yes | Yes, with time gaps | Yes | Similar to Time Subdivision, but time gaps are allowed (e.g., if there is silence in a sentence). | | . | Symbolic Subdivision | Yes | No | Yes | Sub-divided annotations that cannot be linked to time intervals. No time gaps allowed. | | . | Symbolic Association | Yes | No | No | One-to-one correspondence between annotation on primary tier and secondary tier. (e.g., a translated version of the primary tier) | | . Back to table of contents . ",

This means that if you are working with hard copies of data (e.g., paper forms, individual participant results), you must ensure that they are safely locked away in a secure location whenever you have to leave from their line of sight. As a member of the transcription team, you always have a responsibility to maintain the security of sensitive information. Please bear in mind, that not all members of your lab are authorized to access certain kinds of protected data, and may not have been trained to do so. As such, when you leave your desk, maybe for a quick break, you should always make sure to lock your computer screens before you leave to prevent any sensitive information from being exposed to non-authorized individuals. On the flip side, leave your laptop screen on, be prepared to find the lid closed when you return. That said, it is also your responsibility to help other members of your lab maintain the same level of oversight in their work. For example, if you see that your fellow lab member has left hard copy forms unattended on your desk, you should put them in a secure location and remind them when you next see them. If you are holding onto a portable device that contains protected information, you should also take care to lock it in a safe place when you leave the room, or to keep it on your person at all times. If possible, avoid storing any confidential data or personal details on portable storage devices and access the local network using only secure methods. If absolutely necessary to use a portable storage device, set access codes to your portable devices and always use strong passwords or access codes. As a reminder, the criteria for a strong password includes: • 8-16 characters • at least one upper case letter • at least one lower case letter • at least one number • at least one special symbol %$ etc. Do check out the NTU guideline on strong passwords for further tips.

    "content": "Firstly, no matter what kind of data breach, your main role is to inform your supervisor immediately, before taking any action. Your supervisor is better equipped than you are to handle such situations. This section is mainly to tell you what happens in case of a data breach. There are different consequences depending on the type and security of data breach. This section will deal with commonly encountered types of data breach. • Losing a portable storage device . | Check that the device is definitely not within secure lab confines. | Check whether another team member has taken custody of the storage device when they noticed it was unsecured. | Check that the device cannot be found in other places known to you. | Tell your supervisor. Be clear when you think it happened, and what data could be compromised. | Make a report to relevant ‘lost and found’ services if applicable. | . • Revealing identifiable information to the wrong email addresses (i.e. contact a wrong parent . | There are a few ways this might happen. The most common is either a) sending an email to the wrong parent on your contact list or b) sending an email blast without ensuring that all recipient emails are kept confidential. | Note that this is a breach of PDPA laws, which will be covered in more detail in the next section of this handbook. | Your job is to be cautious when sending emails. | Make sure you remember to use the BCC function in all circumstances. | Always sign off using “[Your Name] for BLIP Lab” at the end of your emails. | In a situation where a breach has occurred, let your supervisor know immediately before trying to handle the situation yourself. | . • Finding that there has been a breach in the secure network (i.e. a hacker) . | Note down what makes you think so. | Let your supervisor know immediately. If they are not available, inform another senior team member immediately. In our team Dr Le Tuan Anh is the person in our team who is best qualified to help us find out if a breach of this kind has occurred, and what steps we should take next. For example, our senior team members may decide to disconnect the server from network, but this decision should only be taken by lab members with Admin privileges. | . • Overhearing a colleague speaking to a non-authorized person about sensitive information gleaned from the data . | Immediately inform your colleague that you think the information they are sharing is protected by the team’s privacy policy. | Check with your colleague whether they think there are legitimate reasons for sharing with this person. | Evaluate whether you think the information is of such a sensitive nature that further action needs to be taken immediately, in which case inform your supervisor or a senior lab member immediately. | Discuss the case with your supervisor when possible and consider whether it would be a suitable topic for discussion at a future team meeting. | . Child protection is our number one priority. In all of the above cases, sensitive information could fall into the hands of malicious actors, including those who may have the intention to harm children. This is a situation you are obligated to prevent at all cost. ",

For Chinese words, add spaces between words in the Chunk tier only. Back to table of contents . Special thanks to Woon Fei Ting (Research Associate at BLIP) for providing the answers to Questions 2 to 5 . 2. Are we required to put a space between the individual Chinese characters in an adjective? (eg 可爱 vs 可 爱) . No space because 可爱 is a word on its own with a different meaning from the individual characters. If the voice on the recording is trying to say something/someone is “cute” then no space please. Back to table of contents . 3. It seems that there should be spacing between characters depicting quantity in Chinese (eg 一 只). Does this apply to plurality as well (eg 我 们)? . 一 and 只 should be separated because it is a number and a classifier. Classifiers have to appear for Mandarin constructions e.g. 个，条，件 and should remain separated from the number value. However, 我们 is a pronoun. This should not be separated because it is again a word on its own with a different meaning from the individual characters. Back to table of contents . 4. What is the convention when transcribing possessive markers in Chinese? (eg 他的 vs 他 的) . Like the number/classifier example above, possessive markers should be separated. Back to table of contents . 5. Is spacing needed between the characters for verbs in Chinese? (eg 看着 vs 看 着 / 长大 vs 长 大) . This one is tricky because Mandarin verbs have different forms. My idea is to separate when words do not have a different lexicalised meaning from the root verb e.g. separate for 看着， 看见，看到 - so for all these examples, the second character changes tense/usage but do not have a different lexicalised meaning that will require a separate dictionary entry BUT when we look at 看来, it does have a different lexicalised meaning from 看（i.e 看来 has its own dictionary entry separate from 看） so we do not separate the characters as it stands as a word on its own. For 长大, I would say do not separate for the same reason as 看来 as in 长大 is a lexicalised word. But if the it is 长帅，长壮，长高 - then we should separate because the meanings of these words cannot be teased apart from the root verb 长。Also these examples will not have separate dictionary entries that is separate from root verb. I have been using this online dictionary as a guide. Back to table of contents . 6. Definition of an Utterance . The basic definition is that utterances can be phrases (one word or more) or whole sentences. For more details, please contact a lab member for our Research Fellow (Dr. Shamala Sundaray)’s complete explanation of what we consider an utterance in the context of transcribing data for our studies. Back to table of contents . 7. I can’t confidently tell where the utterance begins and ends. The best way around this problem is to turn the audio rate down to 70, switch to segmentation mode, and press enter when you hear an utterance begin and end. Or you can use annotation mode and judge roughly by the shape of the sound wave where the utterance begins and ends. There is a caveat to using annotation mode though, because the sound wave is the combined to the audio of everything occurring in the recording. Using the sound wave to judge the beginning and end of the utterance might not always work. Segmentation mode is likely to cause less mistakes, but will definitely require practice. If you thought you had reached the end of the utterance but it turned out you had not, there is a handy little tool in ELAN known as Merge Annotation. You can merge with the annotation before or after your selected annotation. Merge Annotation can be found by right clicking your selected annotation on the primary tier. Back to table of contents . 8. When do I use annotation mode and when do I use segmentation mode? . It is better to use segmentation mode for accuracy’s sake. However, one situation in which annotation mode will definitely be easier is when there is a large amount of tiers, in which there are many participants and the participants frequently switch between languages. Honestly, you can toggle between both as far as is convenient for you, but as a rule, if you have upwards of three participants, at least two of which use two or more languages and show a high amount of overlap in their speech, annotation mode will probably be easier for you. Back to table of contents . 9. What shall I do with this brief inaudible section? . Just ignore the inaudible part and move on. Inaudible sections are useless to language programmers. However, if you feel like it may still be important for the context, transcribe it as ### in the Utterance and Chunk tiers, then tag it as “Vocal Sounds” in the language tier. Back to table of contents . 10. What shall I do with this long stretch in which none of the spoken words are audible? . Because the recording technology isn’t perfect, there will be sections where all conversation becomes extensively muffled. If this goes on for a significant period of time, say more than two minutes, select the section and add a comment in the “Comments” tab. Write “Muffled/Inaudible”. Follow the instructions in the making a comment section on the Transcribing wiki page for guidance on how to make a comment in ELAN. Back to table of contents . 11. The speakers were talking at the same time and I can’t quite make out what they’re saying. What shall I do? . If there are instances of overlapping speech (i.e., speakers talking at the same time), try your best to transcribe one speaker at a time. That is, isolate your focus to transcribing one speaker instead of two speakers simultaneously. If that’s not possible at all, select the section and add a comment in the “Comments” tab. Write “Overlapping speech”. Back to table of contents . 12. Do we need to transcribe background speech/sounds? . There is no need to prioritise transcribing background speech/sounds if it is not part of the conversation of interest. Refer to question 9. Back to table of contents . 13. What shall I do when I am unsure of who said a particular thing? . If you can’t figure out who has said a particular thing, create a participant called “Unknown1” by following the instructions in the Transcribing Dependent Tiers wiki page. Set up the tier properties as outlined in the Guide to All Your Tiers wiki page. Back to table of contents . 14. I know the language they are speaking but I don’t know what they’re saying. Create a cell for the utterance and chunk, and label the language on the Language tier only. Leave the other tiers blank. Make a comment to alert the next transcriber/your supervisor about the instance’s occurrence and timestamp in the recording. Follow the instructions in the making a comment section on the Transcribing wiki page for guidance on how to make a comment in ELAN. Back to table of contents . 15. I don’t know what language they are speaking. Mark it on the Language Tier as #!#?. Leave the other three tiers blank. Add a comment and inform your supervisor. Follow the instructions in the making a comment section on the Transcribing wiki page for guidance on how to make a comment in ELAN. Back to table of contents . 16. I want to mark the utterance as inaudible but I can’t even tell who said it. Add a comment and write “Inaudible - speaker unknown”. Follow the instructions in the making a comment section on the Transcribing wiki page for guidance on how to make a comment in ELAN. Back to table of contents . 17. Redacting Human Names . The baby’s name is to be transcribed as BABYNAME if mentioned in the text. Names of researchers present are to be transcribed as their corresponding researcher code. Mentions of names of people involved in the lives of the participants outside the context of the recording are to be unilaterally transcribed as ADULTNAME. Note protocol for protected and confidential information that needs checking should be tagged as “:PROTECTED – CHECK” accordingly in a comment. Follow the instructions in the making a comment section on the Transcribing wiki page for guidance on how to make a comment in ELAN. Back to table of contents . 18. Discourse markers vs interjections . Discourse markers are terms that are directly associated with Singaporean use of English. Interjections are named as such because they are not associable with any one single language ie they are used regardless of language and hence cannot be identified as a single one. Back to table of contents . 19. Is this an Interjection, Discourse marker, or should i just tag it as part of a Language? . Look at who is saying it. If it’s a baby, class it as :v:vocalization under the Baby (Language) Tier. If it’s an adult, it can be tagged as the following: . | An Interjection | A Discourse Marker | A Language | Vocal Sound | . Follow the following rules when making your decision: . | If it exists in the middle of the sentence, but is used in a more Singaporean English context (you decide what that is) it is a discourse marker | If it fits all the criteria for an interjection, but the adult is saying it to entertain the baby instead of fulfilling some kind of pragmatic linguistic function, class it as “Vocal Sound”. | . Back to table of contents . 20. Usage of non-English Bound Morphemes with English words. Depends on the situation. As a rule, decide whether: . | Does the non-English morpheme have a grammatical function, or is it just a sound inflection? If it’s just for sound effect, tag the section as English. | . | If it does have a grammatical function, tag the root word as English and tag the morpheme as the relevant language, using the format for tagging bound morphemes to be found in “List of Special Characters”. | . | Caveat: if it’s an English word with a bound morpheme in an otherwise non-English sentence, ask yourself if there is there another means to express this in the original language? If there is not, the English is the loanword and the whole thing should be tagged as part of the default language. If there is a means to express this in the original language, tag the English word as English and the rest of the Utterance as the relevant non-English language. | . Example of first case: . Example of second case: . Back to table of contents . 21. Do utterances need to have proper capitalisation and punctuation when transcribed? . Utterances do not need capitalisation and punctuation when transcribed. There are a few exceptions that we allow. These include: . | Censoring personal information (e.g., BABYNAME, QUALTRICSID) | Question marks (?) e.g., what is that? | Ellipsis to indicate stuttering/interrupted speech (…) e.g. She told me that she t… took the taxi | Tildes (~) to indicate long interjections (e.g., ohh~) | Colons/equal/plus signs used within the special coding conventions e.g., :v:laughing (see List of Special Codes section of the wiki) | Three pound signs (###) to indicate unintelligible/inaudible speech. | Apostrophes (‘) in contractions e.g., can’t, don’t, shouldn’t | Hyphens (-) for word connecting forms e.g., jalan-jalan | . Back to table of contents . 22. What should I do with tiers that I don’t use from the template file? . Ignore them and DO NOT delete them. If you don’t need to use them, don’t annotate on them. Back to table of contents . 23. What are the three tiers that always need to have annotated cells? . The Utterance, Chunk, and Language tiers. Note: The Translation tier should also have annotated cells should there be any instances of non-English utterances that need to be translated into English. Back to table of contents . 24. How do we transcribe numbers? . Spell them out in the annotation e.g., “There are 3 apples” should be transcribed as there are three apples . For the Talk Together Study, if the numbers mentioned bare resemblance to the participant’s Talk Together Study/Qualtrics ID (5 digit number), transcribe it as QUALTRICSID .

    "title": "A.\tTHE IMPORTANCE OF DATA PROTECTION",
    "content": "Note: All text largely adapted from external sources will have links to the source given below the headers. The below text was written by BLIP Lab staff unless otherwise indicated. 1. Ethical Duty . When participants agree to take part in a study, they have implicit expectations that the researchers have policies in place to protect their identity and personal data. Researchers thus have a duty to protect the privacy and confidentiality of people who participate in their research. In practice, this means: . | Protecting access to individuals, their identities and their personal information | Ensuring that the individual participant (and their legal guardians) have the right to authorise access to their personal information | Not sharing collected information in any identifiable way, unless explicit permission has been given by the participant or their legal guardian in a ‘release’ document. | . What could happen if a participant’s data is not protected? . | Participants’ data could be vulnerable to malicious actors. | A data leak could potentially cause serious personal cost to participants. | The lab would be vulnerable to reputational damage which may, for example, impact the number of people in Singapore who trust us enough to participate in our studies | The lab would be vulnerable to the administrative burden of institutional investigation. | . Types of data that must be protected . Deeply confidential things may be revealed during the course of a long-stretch recording. These include, but are not limited to: . | Protected information about participants’ personal information (e.g., identity, address) | Sensitive information about people in the recording, or people mentioned in the recording (e.g., sexual orientation, relationship status, criminal behavior, religious beliefs) | Confidential medical information (e.g., a recent diagnosis) | Confidential information pertaining to participants’ work lives (e.g., confidential client information, HR related matters, matters that may be commercial-in-confidence) | . Note that if an audio recording contains information of this type, do not transcribe the sensitive/confidential portion until you have discussed this matter with your supervisor. You may use the following code to mark the potentially protected stretch of audio: “:PROTECTION-CHECK”. There will be weekly team meetings to discuss the contents of these protected sections. The only exceptions to this rule are information pertaining to the Mandatory Reporting Policy, detailed in section E above. 2. Introduction to Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) (Largely adapted from the NTU STUDENT LEADERS Compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) document) . The PDPA governs the collection, use, disclosure and care of personal data in Singapore by organizations. It recognizes both the rights of individuals to protect their personal data, including rights of access and correction, and the needs of organizations to collect, use or disclose personal data for legitimate and reasonable purposes. Every university organization, as data user who controls the collection, holding, processing, disclosure, transfer or use of personal data, must observe the personal data privacy rights of an individual. NOTE: At BLIP Lab it isn’t always aligned with the data integrity of our research to ‘correct’ data after a person has completed their participation in a study. For example, we should not alter a test score after the test has concluded, and we should not edit the text of a transcription to suit a participants’ recall of events. That said, there may be cases where a parent provides valuable contextual information that can be incorporated (e.g., the name of a pet), or a missing data (e.g., a missing page from a paper survey). Participants can always request that some portion of their data be removed from a study after the fact. However, once anonymized data have been archived in a public repository, it will not be possible to identify which participant is which. 2.1 What is Personal Data? . Personal data refers to data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified from that data; or from that data and other information to which the organization has or is likely to have access. The term “personal data” should be interpreted broadly and covers all types of data from which an individual can be identified. Examples: Full Name, Residential Address, Mobile Number, NRIC/Passport Number, Matriculation Number, Bank Account Details, Personal Image etc. 2.2 Consequences of Breaching PDPA . If the PDPC finds that an organization is in breach of any of the data protection provisions in the PDPA, it may give the organization such directions that it thinks appropriate to ensure compliance. These directions may include requiring the organization to: . | Stop collecting, using or disclosing personal data in contravention of the Act; | Destroy personal data collected in contravention of the Act; | Provide access to or correct the personal data; and/or | Pay a financial penalty of an amount not exceeding $1 million. | . There are certain situations where the breach is considered serious enough that the PDPA office of Singapore is legally obligated to be immediately notified. For more about the PDPA, follow this link. NTU has its own statement regarding the Personal Data Protection Act, which should be read and adhered to strictly. You can find it here. 3. Important Aspects of Data Security (Largely adapted from University of Leicester - Data Management Support for Researchers) . Security Confidentiality Storage . 3.1 Security Whatever research data you have, whether or not it is legally defined as sensitive or confidential (with associated legal requirements over its management), you need to keep it secure and control access to it. Security encompasses the following points: . | Both electronic and physical security. | Security of both electronic and physical resources (it is wasted effort to enforce appropriate electronic security but leave physical copies of data open for others to access). | Prevention of accidental or malicious damage or modification to data. | Theft of data. | Appropriate access control to data resources – establishing boundaries around your data, defining who can and can’t access, what they can do with it. | Compliance with confidentiality, privacy and consent agreement and legislation. | Release of data before assurance of accuracy and authenticity, and the potential to void intellectual property claims. | What devices are used to store data in the short, medium and long-term. | How data is transferred between devices e.g. interviews captured on digital recorders in the field being transferred to University research data storage. | The use and security of storage devices, particularly mobile devices e.g. external hard drives and laptops, and use of appropriate encryption. | . 3.2 Confidentiality Confidentiality can be defined in terms of “that which is intended to be kept secret”. Dealing with its implications and ethical and legal obligations is an integral part of research. Storage of data that are considered confidential or sensitive may need to be addressed during consent procedures, to inform the people to whom the data belong how and why the data will be stored. The risks of identification of personal information are typically maintained through the anonymisation of data and the regulation of access through a dedicated rights management framework. 3.2.1 How should I store confidential data? It is important to be aware of the risks of storing personal data. Legally, data containing personal information must be treated with more care than non-identifiable data. From mid-2008 financial penalties can be enforced for the wilful circulation of personal data. Personal information can be removed from data files and stored separately under more stringent security measures. Signed consent forms or other non-digital records may contain identifying information and should be stored separately from data files, although an anonymous ID system can help link the two sets of materials together if required (e.g. for re-contacting purposes).” . The main consideration when thinking of a good storage medium are: . | Will the data be securely stored over time – will integrity be preserved? | Is its storage reliable - will data be lost? | Can the data be accessed to be used and reused? | Is it appropriate for both immediate and long-term needs? | Does storage meet relevant standards and requirements of the university, my funder, and legislation? | What is appropriate storage for sensitive, identifiable, pseudonymised and anonymised data With consideration to the above points, portable storage media such as CDs, DVDs and memory sticks (also known as USB sticks, flash drives, thumb drives, memory keys) present a high level of risk when being used to store research data.  They are not backed up centrally and are vulnerable to loss and damage. Portable media are also particularly vulnerable to loss, damage and degradation over time. NOTE: Therefore, in this lab, portable media devices are only for sharing of data within the lab. After sharing is completed, all data will be deleted from the portable media device. | . ",

For when the adult individual makes a repeated rhythmic sound. It can only be classed as a vocal sound, however because we do not want to lose the transcribable data, code it first as :v:r, then add another colon at the back and transcribe the contents of the utterance. For instance the rhythm goes dadadada. Code it as :v:r:dadadada. Note that before coding this you should check that this is not a case of mimicking. :v:u: is used to designate Vocal Sounds that cannot be classified. When transcribing these, type v:u then a colon, then transcribe the actual words after the second colon. Back to table of contents . 3. Non Vocal Sounds . :s:{closed class} . :s: is for Non Vocal Sounds. Tag these articles as “Non Vocal Sound” under the Language Tier.

No need tag on language Tier. Instead of encoding this code on the Utterance Tier, encode this in a comment. | . Back to table of contents . 4. Singing . :si:{open class} . :si: is just for singing. All space between lyrics must be replaced by “+”. Tag this in the Language Tier as whatever Language tag is applicable. This means if the individual is singing in English, tag it in the Language Tier as English, but if the individual is singing nonsense syllables, tag is as “Vocal Sounds”. Examples . | Description | Marking | Tag on Language Tier | . | Adult singing | :si:mary+had+a+little+lamb | Relevant Language. “Vocal Sounds” if nonsense syllables | . | Adult humming | :si:humming | Vocal Sounds | . Back to table of contents . 5. Mimicking . :m:{open class} . :m: is for mimicking. All space between words must be replaced by “+”.

This means if the individual is mimicking English words, tag it in the Language Tier as English, but if the individual is mimicking nonsense syllables, tag is as “Vocal Sounds”. | Description | Marking | Tag on Language Tier | . | Parent Mimicking Child vocalization | :m:gagagaga | Relevant Language. “Vocal Sounds” if nonsense syllables | . Back to table of contents . 6. Discourse markers . :d:{closed class} . :d: is for discourse markers . Discourse markers are sentence endings like “la”, “lor”, “leh”, or “hor”. They have a Language tier tag of ‘Red Dot’. Examples . | Description | Marking | . | Adult uses a discourse marker in their speech | :d:lah | . List of Discourse Markers . | hor | la | leh | lor | wah | ma | na | eh | ah | . Back to table of contents . 7. Loanwords . :l:langname:{open class} . This is for Loanwords. For more strange loanwords such as “sabo” just put it as a loanword from English. Back to table of contents . 8. Bound Morphemes . ={open} . This is for Bound Morphemes. Bound Morphemes . Bound morphemes are classed as =BoundMorpheme. So if the Bound morpheme is =le, it will be Mainword =le. If the bound morpheme comes from a different language tag the language accordingly. Back to table of contents . 9. Unclear or unknown language . #!#langname and #!#? . Unclear language will be noted as #!#langname in the Language tier, #!#Malay for example. Completely unknown language will be noted as #!#? in the Language tier. Back to table of contents . 10. Special Cases . Special cases will be addressed here as and when they pop up. In the case of a person singing an animal sound, class it as Singing then type in the words. Because the Singing class is an open class category.

Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] (Chunk)”. The complete name should look like Mother (Chunk). Parent (primary tier): “[person_name] (Utterance)” . Tier Type: Chunk_TimeSub (Time Subdivision stereotype, no use of controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Language Tier . Purpose: This tier is for transcribing utterances in terms of what fine-grained language is spoken. For example, let us look at the sentence “他喜欢吃hamburger”. “他喜欢吃” will be labelled as ‘Mandarin’ but “hamburger” will be labelled as English. This tier differs from the Matrix tier (see Matrix Tier sub-section). Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] (Language)”. The complete name should look like Mother (Language). Parent (primary) tier: “[person_name] (Chunk)” . Tier Type: Lang_TimeSub (Time Subdivision sterotype, Languages controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Target_EL Tier . Purpose: EL stands for ‘English’. This tier is for transcribing ‘target’ English words. Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] Target_EL”. The complete name should look like Mother (Target_EL). Parent (primary tier): “[person_name] (Chunk)” . Tier Type: Target_Words_Eng_IncIn (Included in stereotype, Target_Words_Eng controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Target_CL Tier . Purpose: CL stands for ‘Mandarin’. This tier is for transcribing ‘target’ Mandarin words. Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] Target_CL”. The complete name should look like Mother (Target_CL). Parent (primary tier): “[person_name] (Chunk)” . Tier Type: Target_Words_Mandarin_IncIn (Included in stereotype, Target_Words_Mandarin controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Target_ML Tier . Purpose: ML stands for ‘Malay’. This tier is for transcribing ‘target’ Malay words. Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] Target_ML”. The complete name should look like Mother (Target_ML). Parent (primary tier): “[person_name] (Chunk)” . Tier Type: Target_Words_Malay_IncIn (Included in stereotype, Target_Words_Malay controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Target_TL Tier . Purpose: TL stands for ‘Tamil’. This tier is for transcribing ‘target’ Tamil words. Unlike the other Target tiers, there is temporarily no controlled vocabulary for the Tamil target words. This is because the ELAN software does not have the functionality (yet) to input Tamil script into the controlled vocabulary window. In the meantime, all Tamil target words must be inputted directly (i.e., typed) on the tiers. Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] Target_TL”. The complete name should look like Mother (Target_TL). Parent (primary tier): “[person_name] (Chunk)” . Tier Type: Target_Words_Tamil_IncIn (Included in stereotype, no controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Translation Tier . Purpose: This tier will contain English translations of non-English utterances. A loose translation of the utterance will suffice i.e., enough information for an outside English reader to understand what is going on. A person who reads the translation tier will be someone who does not speak the language. Translate the utterance into English as if you were trying to explain it to someone who does not speak the language. Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] (Translation)”. The complete name should look like Mother (Translation). Parent (primary) tier: “[person_name] (Utterance)” . Tier Type: Translation (Symbolic Association stereotype, no use of controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Matrix Tier . THIS TIER CAN CURRENTLY BE IGNORED AND NOT BE USED. HOWEVER, DO NOT DELETE IT! . Purpose: In contrast to the Language tier that focuses on the fine-grained language spoken in the utterance, the Matrix tier focuses on transcribing the language that encapsulates the utterance. While both Mandarin and English are spoken in the sentence “他喜欢吃hamburger”, the Matrix language will be Mandarin. This is because “hamburger” (English) is embedded into the utterance’s Mandarin sentence structure. The name of this tier was inspired by the concepts of matrix clauses and subordinate clauses. For an easy-to-understand explanation of these concepts, please read this post from AllThingsLinguistic. Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] (Matrix)”. The complete name should look like Mother (Matrix). Parent (primary) tier: “[person_name] (Utterance)” . Tier Type: Matrix_Lang (Symbolic Association stereotype, Matrix_Languages controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . ",
