All baby noises are to be sorted into the above four categories. The category of the noise made should be marked in the Baby (Language) tier. Recognizable words should be transcribed on the tier labelled Baby (Utterance), Baby (Chunk), and Baby (Translation) if applicable. Languageless should NOT be used and tagged in the Baby (Language) tier. ",

    "content": "In all cases, try your best to transcribe the baby’s babbling exactly. But if the babbling or vocalization is unintelligible, mark it in the Baby (Utterance) and Baby (Chunk) tier as ###. This can stand for a whole line or it can be inserted for a word of phrase. Remember, do not put punctuation after ### in your transcript. Do not transcribe only part of a word as ###. For example, you should never transcribe ###ing or ###ed. Also, ### should be a standalone token, it should not be with anything else, e.g. :m:### or :si:###. After you are done transcribing the utterances in the Baby Utterance and Chunk tier, you need to add the baby noise category in the Baby (Language) tier. For crying, annotate ### in the Utterance and Chunk tiers and tag it as :v:crying under the Baby (Language) tier. For singing, if the baby is singing actual words it should be tagged to its respective language in the Baby (Language) tier. However, if the baby’s singing are similar to babbling and you are unable to make out its language, it should be tagged as :v:vocalizations in the Baby (Language) tier. Idiosyncratic words. Sometimes children invent words that have nothing to do with the standard, adult version of the word. For example, a child might say “neenee” meaning “guitar” or “Amwes” meaning “Nemo”. If the idiosyncratic word has a clearly identifiable meaning that occurs in at least one obvious context, transcribe the word as it sounds, followed by the @ symbol, and indicate the word and its meaning after the @. e.g., neenee@guitar. Under the Language tier, it will be tagged as :v:vocalizations . If an adult mimics an idiosyncratic word, it will be annotated the same way in its Utterance and Chunk tiers but will be tagged as its respective language in the Language tier. For this example, since guitar is an English word it will be tagged as English . Where the baby is mimicking an adult speaking, note it in the “Baby (Utterance)” and “Baby (Chunk)” tiers with :m: preceding the mimicked word/utterance e.g., :m:baba if the baby was mimicking an adult saying baba.

With regards to the Talk Together Study (TTS), if you need to make edits to a file that you are checking, please “Save As” a new file and follow the respective file naming conventions for the transcription checker as outlined on the TTS ELAN File Naming Conventions page of the wiki. Checker/Transcriber 2 (Column N) and Date Issued (Column O) of the transcription log will be completed by the person on the Audio Processing team who passes you the file to check. For the columns that you have to complete as a checker, please see point number 12 in the step-by-step checking procedure below.

    "title": "Step-by-step checking procedure",
    "content": "Don’t forget to watch/listen to the media file in full before you begin the checking process. Ensure you also adjust the vertical zoom (right click on the waveform &gt; Vertical Zoom &gt; adjust the %) and horizontal zoom (adjust the slider at the bottom right of the ELAN screen) to help you see the waveform more clearly in ELAN. In order to see the hierarchical relationship between the dependent tiers, right click on the tier sidebar &gt; Sort Tiers &gt; Sort by Hierarchy. 1. Check that they have followed the file naming convention(s) . Refer to the relevant page on the wiki depending on which project’s data you are working on. Ensure that the transcriber ID is used instead of the transcriber initials. If initials are used, you should replace it in the filename. 2. Check that they have used the newest ELAN transcription template. All Interjection tags in the language tiers should be Languageless. If a retired version of template is used, import the new template BLIP_Languageless_Guide_20210920.docx according to the step-by-step instructions sent out on 20th Sept 2021. After that, replace all mentions of Interjection tags to Languageless using the Find and Replace function. It should be noted that when importing the new template, the tier attributes will be reset. For example, P12345TT will be reset to PxxxxTT and the annotator fields will be empty. Fill in the relevant fields again. 3. Check that they have edited the placeholder IDs in the tier attributes to reflect the participant’s actual study ID . Any placeholder Participant IDs in Tier Attributes should be edited with the actual participant study ID for all the primary and secondary tiers of the speakers present in the recording. The placeholder IDs should be replaced even if the tier is not utilised. For example, if the ID is P1234TT and Mother and Baby are present, the placeholder IDs PxxxxTT should be replaced to reflect P1234TT for all the Mother and Baby primary and secondary tiers. The participant tiers include: Utterance, Chunk, Language, Target_EL, Target_ML, Target_CL, Target_TL, Matrix, Translation, and Sensitive_Masking. Change any Transcriber Initials to Transcriber ID for Tier Attributes and comments. 4. Check for all the errors mentioned in this video . | Misalignments i.e. spoken word was not fully captured in annotation | Typos | Mistranscriptions i.e. what was annotated did not correspond to the recording | Missing annotations | . 5. Check that chunks have been tagged with the appropriate language tag . e.g., a Mandarin chunk should not be tagged as English or Vocal Sound. When encountered with the #!#?, listen to the utterance and resolve it accordingly. When checking for unknown language tags in the transcription file (#!#?), it is possible to find that the parent is speaking in a language that is outside of the language list. If you are able to confidently identify the language the parent is speaking, identify its corresponding ISO 639-2 language code here. After which, use the following format to tag such segments: . | :v:l:iso639_2_{iso 639-2 language code} | . Example one: tagging Spanish segments in a transcription file. The ISO 639-2 code for Spanish is spa. Thus, Spanish segments would be tagged as follows: . Example two: tagging Japanese segments in a transcription file. The ISO 639-2 code for Japanese is jpn. Thus, a Japanese segment would be tagged as follows: . If you are unable to identify the language, do flag it to the team. When we know the parent is speaking another language as indicated in their profile (e.g., README file) but we are not confident to identify the language, we assume the language to be undetermined. The ISO 639-2 code for undetermined language is und. Thus, such segments would be tagged with :v:l:iso639_2_und as seen in the example below: . 6. Check that there are no typos/unecessary spaces in the Utterance/Chunk tiers . Keep an eye out for any occurrence of a typo. Generally, annotations should not have unecessary spaces. The exception to this is for Chinese transcripts. For Chinese transcripts: . | Spaces should be added in between Chinese words in the Chunk tier but not the Utterance tier. Questions regarding this have been answered in the Frequently Asked Questions by our Research Associate Woon Fei Ting. | For the Utterance tier, spaces should be placed to separate Chinese characters from text that aren’t Chinese characters. e.g., “she eats 那个 uh 汉堡包 :v:laughter” should be written in the Utterance tier as she eats 那个 uh 大大的汉堡包 :v:laughter and NOT as she eats那个uh大大的汉堡包:v:laughter The exception to this rule is question marks e.g. orangutan is sad 对不对?. | . 7. Check for loanwords and bound morphemes. When checking the transcription, look out for possible loanwords and bound morphemes. Mark them with the specific conventions outlined here and here. Check out the Frequently Asked Questions for non-English morphemes and English words. 8. Check that the activity markers have been placed appropriately . Please refer to the Transcribing Talk Together Study Tasks page on the wiki for guidance on where to add activity marker tiers when transcribing Talk Together Study recordings. 9. Check that there are no unecessary empty cells or missing annotations . There should always be annotations on the Utterance, Chunk, and Language tier. There should also be annotations on the corresponding Translation and Sensitive_Masking tier if applicable. 10. Check that there are no unecessarily long cells . This point circles back to referencing Shamala’s “A problem named Utterance” document here to make sure what has been annotated is a proper utterance. 11. Check that all timestamps are positive . This is an unusual and uncommon occurrence, but we have had instances in the past where chunks have had negative timestamps. 12. Check that all instances of redactable information has been isolated and annotated on the Sensitive_Masking tier . Please see the tier guide for more information on the Sensitive_Masking tier. Any mention of the baby’s name must ALWAYS be redacted with the corresponding redaction code. Live demo on how to use the Sensitive_Masking tier here. For transcripts completed before March 12 2021, ensure that the “Sensitive_Masking” tier has been added: . As per protocol change on March 12 2021, all transcripts should have a Sensitive_Masking tier. Transcripts that were being worked on prior to this date may not have this tier and the corresponding annotations that isolate and redact instances that should remain confidential (e.g., mention of the baby’s name or confidential conversations). Follow these steps to add the Sensitive_Masking tier: . | With the .eaf open, go to ‘Edit’ &gt; ‘Edit Controlled Vocabularies’ | The external Controlled Vocabulary Window should pop up. | Click ‘External CV’ and ‘Browse’ to import the Sensitive_Masking controlled vocabulary (BLIP_TTS_sensitive_masking_controlledvocab_20210315.ecv which can be found in the same Onedrive folder as the ELAN template) | Close the Controlled Vocabulary Window once the Sensitive_Masking CV has been imported succesfully (i.e., it appears in the window) | In the toolbar, go to ‘Type’ &gt; ‘Add New Tier Type’. | Enter Sensitive_Masking_IncIn in the Type Name | Select Included in as the Sterotype in the dropdown menu | Select Sensitive_Masking as the Controlled Vocabulary in the dropdown menu | Click add. You have now created the Sensitive_Masking_IncIn tier type. | Create the Sensitive_Masking tier for each of the participants in the template (Baby, Mother, Father, Resercher). | . 13. Upload the .eaf file into the BELA dashboard to see if you missed out anything during the checking process (don’t worry, it happens!) . When you enter the BELA dashboard once the .eaf has been uploaded: . | Under the ‘Lexicon’ section (hit Toggle to reveal), click Highlight Unknown Words, then click the Lexicon Tab. | Check all sub-tabs in the lexicon tab for words highlighted in red (e.g., typos), or words that should be tagged differently (e.g., an English word that was tagged as Malay). You may also get some highlighted in red that are not actually errors (e.g., Proper names, “mama”, etc.) Use your best judgement on whether or not it should be corrected. If you are unsure, ask someone on the Audio Processing team. | Under the Full Transcript section (hit Toggle to reveal), check the checkbox for Show Errors Only. This will isolate any errors that need fixing (e.g., a chunk missing a language tag). | Fix the errors highlighted by the BELA dashboard | Re-upload the transcript again to ensure no more errors are present. | Repeat the steps if necessary. | . 14. Update the transcription log . Update the transcription log during and after completing the checking process. Columns of the transcription log that should be filled by the checker include: Completion (Column P), Comments by checker (Column Q), and Transcribed filename (Column R). Inform your supervisor that you have completed the checking process. Checker/Transcriber 2 (Column N) and Date Issued (Column O) of the transcription log will be completed by the person on the Audio Processing team who passes you the file to check.

    "content": "In order to understand how to use a Controlled Vocabulary, you need to first understand what a Type is. A type dictates what list of controlled vocabulary is used with a tier. You can create a ‘type’ so that more than one tier can share controlled vocabulary, or create multiple types, so that different tiers can have different controlled vocabulary. For example, say you are annotating an audio clip where a participant is recording a word list. You want to have one tier, called “Segment”, where you break down the word into individual phonemes (smallest unit of sound e.g., the word ‘cat’ has three phonemes /k/, /a/, and /t/). You also want another tier, called “Word”, for annotating the whole word. On the “Segment” tier, there are too many different consonants, vowels, and diacritics to have a controlled vocabulary so you can give it a type “S”. Type “S” is not associated with a controlled vocabulary so you can type in whatever text you want into each cell while annotating. On the “Word” tier, there are a limited number of words since the participant is reading from a word list so you can give it a type “W”. Type “W” is associated with a controlled vocabulary so you can choose the word you want to make annotation quicker. This example will walk you through the process of assigning a tier’s type, and assigning a controlled vocabulary to its own corresponding tier type. This is a new file. The default tier, as shown is named default. Firstly we go to “Edit” -&gt; “Edit Controlled Vocabulary” to add a Controlled Vocabulary, as such. Then, you to go “Type” and “Add New Tier Type” to establish which tier corresponds with which Controlled Vocabulary, as follows. When the tier types have been set up, the screen will look like this: . Then you go to “Tier” to Change the attributes of the existing “default” tier. Change the name of the Tier to “Tier 1”. Change the Type of the Tier from “default-lt” to “New Type” . Click “Change”. Tier 1 can now access the Controlled Vocabulary “Test”. As seen in the following example. Back to table of contents . ",

A tier is visual space where you section portions of the audio to then be labeled. You can have multiple tiers, meaning you can section the same portion of audio in several different ways. The picture below shows two empty tiers. Back to table of contents . 1.2 What is a cell? . A cell is a section of a tier for which the annotator has marked a beginning and an end that can be labelled. (e.g. the annotator marks the beginning of the cell labeled “bat” at the release of the /b/ in “bat” and the end of cell at end of /t/). Depending on the type of transcription you are doing, you might want to create cells for each word, or for whole phrases, or for some other feature of interest. The picture below shows an empty cell on tier 1 that is ready to be annotated. Back to table of contents . 1.3 What is an annotation? . When you have created a cell inside a tier and labeled it, this is called an annotation. In the picture below, there are two tiers containing annotations. Tier 2 contains an annotation of the utterance as a whole, while Tier 1 contains annotations of the utterance sub-divided into individual words. Back to table of contents . 1.4 Different Modes . You can switch between modes by going to “Options” and selecting which mode you would like to go to, as shown in the picture below. There are different modes for creating annotations. The main modes are ‘annotation mode’, ‘segmentation mode’, and ‘transcription mode’. Back to table of contents . 1.4.1 Segmentation Mode . Segmentation mode is the mode you use to segment the audio into cells by placing boundaries on a tier. When you use this mode, you can come back afterwards, and fill in which word is which later. The photo below shows a screen on segmentation mode, with the “Baby” tier selected to have sections of it segmented. Back to table of contents . 1.4.2 Annotation Mode . Annotation mode is the default mode that is active when you open a file in ELAN. This mode is what you use to define the contents of each cell. Once you have created cells using segmentation mode (as in section 1.4.1), you can transcribe them in annotation mode by double-clicking on the cells and either typing in text or choosing from a drop-down menu of words from a controlled vocabulary. Back to table of contents . 1.4.3 Transcription Mode . Transcription mode is another mode in which you can transcribe each cell formed in segmentation mode by either typing in text for each cell or choosing text from a controlled vocabulary. Transcription is faster in this mode as you can move from one cell to the next automatically without having to double-click each new cell. Back to table of contents . ",

    "content": ". | Background | Tier type stereotypes | . 2.1 Background . For a video version of this section, see the “Intro to ELAN dependent tiers” video from our playlist. Tiers in ELAN can be independent or be dependent on/refer to other tiers. Independent tiers consist of annotations linked to the time axis. Dependent tiers contain annotations linked to annotations on a primary/parent tier, and can optionally be linked to the time axis. These dependent tiers are in hierarchical primary-secondary (parent-child) relationships. The image below is an example of a tier hierarchy. “Mother” is the primary tier with six secondary tiers (Language, Chunk, Words, Morpheme, POS, and Translation) . Note: ELAN formally refers to the dependent tiers as “parent” and “child” tiers. This may be a bit confusing in our context as we transcribe recorded discourse from actual families. As such, the parent tier will henceforth be referred to as “primary”, and the child tier will be “secondary” . Changes made to the primary tier, such as deleting the tier or adjusting the time interval, will affect the secondary tier. The primary tier’s time interval cannot be adjusted independently. Moreover, deleting the secondary tier will not affect the primary tier. Back to table of contents . 2.2 Tier type stereotypes . Each tier is assigned a type stereotype (constraints enforced on the tier). For example, whether or not the annotations in a primary tier will be subdivided in the secondary tier and time-aligned. The choice of which stereotype is used depends on the objectives and purpose of a transcription task. The table below is a summary of ELAN tier type stereotypes. | Stereotype Name | Dependent (i.e., must have primary tier) | Time-aligned | Sub-divided annotations | Description | Example | . | None | No | Yes | No | Cannot have a primary tier. Non-overlapping annotations on an independent tier linked to the time axis | | . | Time Subdivision | Yes | Yes, with no time gaps | Yes | Sub-divided annotations from the primary tier that are linked to the primary’s time interval. No time gaps between sub-divided annotation units. | | . | Included in | Yes | Yes, with time gaps | Yes | Similar to Time Subdivision, but time gaps are allowed (e.g., if there is silence in a sentence). | | . | Symbolic Subdivision | Yes | No | Yes | Sub-divided annotations that cannot be linked to time intervals. No time gaps allowed. | | . | Symbolic Association | Yes | No | No | One-to-one correspondence between annotation on primary tier and secondary tier. (e.g., a translated version of the primary tier) | | . Back to table of contents . ",

    "content": "In the lab, you must ensure that data is always closely monitored and secured. This means that if you are working with hard copies of data (e.g., paper forms, individual participant results), you must ensure that they are safely locked away in a secure location whenever you have to leave from their line of sight. As a member of the transcription team, you always have a responsibility to maintain the security of sensitive information. Please bear in mind, that not all members of your lab are authorized to access certain kinds of protected data, and may not have been trained to do so. As such, when you leave your desk, maybe for a quick break, you should always make sure to lock your computer screens before you leave to prevent any sensitive information from being exposed to non-authorized individuals. On the flip side, leave your laptop screen on, be prepared to find the lid closed when you return. That said, it is also your responsibility to help other members of your lab maintain the same level of oversight in their work. For example, if you see that your fellow lab member has left hard copy forms unattended on your desk, you should put them in a secure location and remind them when you next see them. If you are holding onto a portable device that contains protected information, you should also take care to lock it in a safe place when you leave the room, or to keep it on your person at all times. If possible, avoid storing any confidential data or personal details on portable storage devices and access the local network using only secure methods. If absolutely necessary to use a portable storage device, set access codes to your portable devices and always use strong passwords or access codes. As a reminder, the criteria for a strong password includes: . | 8-16 characters | at least one upper case letter | at least one lower case letter | at least one number | at least one special symbol %$ etc. | . Do check out the NTU guideline on strong passwords for further tips: . https://pwd.ntu.edu.sg/ . ",

    "content": "Firstly, no matter what kind of data breach, your main role is to inform your supervisor immediately, before taking any action. Your supervisor is better equipped than you are to handle such situations. This section is mainly to tell you what happens in case of a data breach. There are different consequences depending on the type and security of data breach. This section will deal with commonly encountered types of data breach. Losing a portable storage device . | Check that the device is definitely not within secure lab confines. | Check whether another team member has taken custody of the storage device when they noticed it was unsecured. | Check that the device cannot be found in other places known to you. | Tell your supervisor. Be clear when you think it happened, and what data could be compromised. | Make a report to relevant ‘lost and found’ services if applicable. | . Revealing identifiable information to the wrong email addresses (i.e. contact a wrong parent . | There are a few ways this might happen. The most common is either a) sending an email to the wrong parent on your contact list or b) sending an email blast without ensuring that all recipient emails are kept confidential. | Note that this is a breach of PDPA laws, which will be covered in more detail in the next section of this handbook. | Your job is to be cautious when sending emails. | Make sure you remember to use the BCC function in all circumstances. | Always sign off using “[Your Name] for BLIP Lab” at the end of your emails. | In a situation where a breach has occurred, let your supervisor know immediately before trying to handle the situation yourself. | . Finding that there has been a breach in the secure network (i.e. a hacker) . | Note down what makes you think so. | Let your supervisor know immediately. If they are not available, inform another senior team member immediately. In our team Dr Le Tuan Anh is the person in our team who is best qualified to help us find out if a breach of this kind has occurred, and what steps we should take next. For example, our senior team members may decide to disconnect the server from network, but this decision should only be taken by lab members with Admin privileges. | . Overhearing a colleague speaking to a non-authorized person about sensitive information gleaned from the data . | Immediately inform your colleague that you think the information they are sharing is protected by the team’s privacy policy. | Check with your colleague whether they think there are legitimate reasons for sharing with this person. | Evaluate whether you think the information is of such a sensitive nature that further action needs to be taken immediately, in which case inform your supervisor or a senior lab member immediately. | Discuss the case with your supervisor when possible and consider whether it would be a suitable topic for discussion at a future team meeting. | . Child protection is our number one priority. In all of the above cases, sensitive information could fall into the hands of malicious actors, including those who may have the intention to harm children. This is a situation you are obligated to prevent at all cost. ",

    "title": "General",
    "content": "1. Defininition of word . An overview of what we at BLIP lab consider a word is outlined in this document here. It is by one of our Research Fellows, Dr. Shamala Sundaray. For Chinese words, add spaces between words in the Chunk tier only. For the Utterance tier, spaces should be placed to separate Chinese characters from text that aren’t Chinese characters. e.g., “she eats 那个 uh 大大的汉堡包 :v:laughter” （Translation: she eats that uh huge hamburger :v:laughter) should be written in the Utterance tier as she eats 那个 uh 大大的汉堡包 :v:laughter and NOT as she eats那个uh大大的汉堡包:v:laughter . The exception to this rule is question marks e.g. orangutan is sad 对不对? (Translation: orangutan is sad, isn’t it?). . 2. What’s an utterance? . Please refer to Shamala’s document entitled “A problem named utterance” for a full overview of how we define an utterance. Another way to think about it: an utterance is what can be considered a single thought process (that can also have interjections). 3. I can’t confidently tell where the utterance begins and ends. The best way around this problem is to turn the audio rate down to 70, switch to segmentation mode, and press enter when you hear an utterance begin and end. Or you can use annotation mode and judge roughly by the shape of the sound wave where the utterance begins and ends. There is a caveat to using annotation mode though, because the sound wave is the combined the audio of everything occurring in the recording, using the sound wave to judge the beginning and end of the utterance might not always work. Segmentation mode is likely to cause less mistakes, but will definitely require practice. If you thought you had reached the end of the utterance but it turned out you had not, there is a handy little tool in ELAN known as Merge Annotation. You can merge with the annotation before or after your selected annotation. Merge Annotation can be found by right clicking your selected annotation. 4. What shall I do with this brief inaudible section? . Just ignore the inaudible part and move on. Inaudible sections are useless to language programmers. However, if you feel like it may still be important for the context, transcribe it as ### in the Utterance and Chunk tiers, then tag it as “Vocal Sounds” in the language tier. 5. What shall I do with this long stretch in which none of the spoken words are audible? . Because the recording technology isn’t perfect, there will be sections where all conversation becomes extensively muffled. If this goes on for a significant period of time, say more than two minutes, select the section and add a comment in the “Comments” tab. Write “Muffled/Inaudible”. 6. The speakers were talking at the same time and I can’t quite make out what they’re saying. What should I do? . If there are instances of overlapping speech (i.e., speakers talking at the same time), try your best to transcribe one speaker at a time. That is, isolate your focus to transcribing one speaker instead of two speakers simultaneously. If that’s not possible at all, select the section and add a comment in the “Comments” tab. Write “Overlapping speech”. 7. Do we need to transcribe background speech/sounds? . There is no need to prioritise transcribing background speech/sounds if it is not part of the conversation of interest (e.g., the story book reading). Refer to question 4. 8. What shall I do when I am unsure of who said a particular thing? . If you can’t figure out who has said a particular thing, create a participant called “Unknown1” by following the instructions in “Transcribing dependent tiers” and set up tier properties as outlined in “A Guide to All Your Tiers” sections of this wiki. 9. Do utterances need to have proper capitalisation and punctuation when transcribed? . Utterances do not need capitalisation and punctuation when transcribed. There are a few exceptions that we allow. These include: . | Censoring personal information (e.g., BABYNAME, QUALTRICSID) | Question marks (?) e.g., what is that? | Ellipsis to indicate stuttering/interrupted speech (…) e.g. She told me that she t… took the taxi. | Ellipsis can also be used to indicate a parent prompting children on words e.g., Mum: a pink um... Child: brella | . | Tildes (~) to indicate long interjections (e.g., ohh~) | Colons/equal/plus signs used within the special coding conventions e.g., :v:laughing (see “List of Special Codes” section of the wiki) | Three pound signs (###) to indicate unintelligible/inaudible speech. | Do note that ### is a standalone token and should not be with anything else, e.g. :m:### or :si:###. | . | Apostrophes (‘) in contractions e.g., can’t, don’t, shouldn’t | Hyphens (-) for word connecting forms e.g., jalan-jalan | . 10. What are the three tiers that always need to have annotated cells? . The Utterance, Chunk, and Language tiers. You will also have to translate the utterance on the Translation tier if you are transcribing non-English utterances. The translation can be a loose translation i.e., enough information for an outside English reader to understand what is going on. 11. How do we transcribe numbers? . Spell them out in the annotation e.g., “There are 3 apples” should be transcribed as there are three apples . For the Talk Together Study, if the numbers mentioned bare resemblance to the participant’s Talk Together Study/Qualtrics ID (5 digit number), transcribe it as QUALTRICSID . 12. How do we spell mispronounced words？ . For transcription, spell it as what you heard but add a comment in ELAN with the standardized/correct spelling of the word. Do not flag it as :v:u: if it’s obviously a mispronounced word. 13. How do we transcribe words which are being spelt out letter by letter? . At times, words might be spelt out letter by letter. In this case, each letter should be followed by an ellipsis. For example, if the word is ‘pea’, it should be transcribed as p... e... a... in the Utterance and Chunk tiers. 14. How should we transcribe a sibling’s speech? . There is a difference in transcription protocols and conventions when transcribing Baby and Adult speech. At times it might be difficult to decide how a sibling’s speech should be transcribed. In order to decide which conventions should be used, do refer to the Sibling tier section.

Discourse markers are typically at the end of the sentence and are tagged with Red Dot language tag, whereas Languageless words may occur in any part of the sentence. 21. Is this a Languageless word, Discourse marker, or should i just tag it as part of a Language? . Below is a table (special thanks to Woon Fei Ting, Research Associate at BLIP Lab) which can help one to decide if a word should be tagged as “Languageless”, “Red Dot (discourse marker)” or another language. If it is spoken by a child/baby, do note that we do not use the “Languageless” tag at all in the Language tier. 22. Usage of non-English Bound Morphemes with English words. Depends on the situation. As a rule, decide whether: . | If it’s just for sound effect, tag it as the language in which the chunk and utterance is in. | If it does have a grammatical function, tag the root word as English and tag the morpheme as the relevant language, using the format for tagging bound morphemes to be found in “List of Special Characters”. | . | Caveat: if it’s an English word with a bound morpheme in an otherwise non-English sentence, ask yourself if there is there another means to express this in the original language? If there is not, the English is the loanword and the whole thing should be tagged as part of the default language. If there is a means to express this in the original language, tag the English word as English and the rest of the Utterance as the relevant non-English language. | . Example of first case: .

Special thanks to Shaza Amran and Nur Sakinah (Research Assistants at BLIP) for providing the answers to the questions in this section . 23. How do I transcribe Malay kinship terms if they are in Other Bahasa (e.g., Javanese) or Arabic? . Malay kinship terms used by Malay families, including loaned words from Other Bahasa (e.g., nyai for grandmother) and Arabic (e.g., ummi for mother), will be tagged as Malay. Check the list of kinship terms used by Malay families in the BLIP dictionary for transcribers. Let us know if you think we’ve missed anything out. If the term sounds like it might be a kinship term but you are not sure, please leave the annotation blank and tag it as . | #!#Bahasa in the Language tier OR | #!#? (if you don’t know the language) in the Language tier. A checker will take note and make changes accordingly. | . 24. How do I transcribe shortened words or ‘bahasa pasar’ (informal language)? . Some sounds in daily or day-to-day language are omitted. Vowel change: Words like aje (informal way of saying sahaja) (trans: ‘only’) . | In spoken Malay, all formal and informal words ending with ‘a’ becomes ‘ə’ (e.g. aja/aje) and ‘i’ to ‘e’ (e.g. amik/amek) . | Sometimes, the vowel ‘u’ is also pronounced as ‘o’ (e.g. lubang vs. lobang but kucing ≠ koceng) . | . Consonant change: Words like kecil (formal) and kecik (informal) (trans: small) . | In spoken Malay, both words can be used in informal settings, so if we follow the standard spelling, we would not know which one is spoken (kecik vs. kecil) | . Contractions: Words like takde (tak de) (formal: tidak ada, trans: not have) . | In English, ‘gonna’ is kept as one word instead of being spelled as ‘going to’ or ‘gon na’ | . Proposed protocol: . | /ʌ/ -&gt; [ɛ] : transcribe final letter as ‘a’ if it sounds like ‘a’, ‘e’ if sounds like ‘e’ (e.g. aje) . | /i/ -&gt; [e] : C_C (‘e’ for shortened words, make a list for unshortened words) (e.g. abeh, kucing), V_C (spell ‘i’) (e.g. air) . | /ɭ/ -&gt; [ʔ] : spell ‘k’ when heard as k-like sound (e.g. kecik) . | . 25. Some of the interjections are in Malay. How do I transcribe them? . Malay interjections such as ‘aduh’ (ouch), ‘aah’ (yes) and ‘amboi’ (wow) will be tagged as Malay when used in a Malay utterance. Otherwise, this may be listed under Red Dot (please refer to the BLIP dictionary for transcribers). Sometimes, we use ‘lah’ as part of our Malay vocab, e.g. ‘lah, bukan payung rupanya’ (meaning ‘oh, it’s not an umbrella’, sometimes spelled as ‘ler’) or ‘baiklah, jom cari daun lain’ (meaning ‘okay, let’s find a different leaf’). These ‘lah’ will be tagged as Malay when used in a Malay utterance. 26. Language mixing within a word . At times, there might be the combining of English prefixes and/or suffixes with a Malay word . | e.g., ‘interestingnya’ - interesting + nya (translation: very) | e.g., ‘kakaks’ - kakak (sister) + ‘s’ (plural) | . For these cases, use the bound morpheme convention and separate at chunk level according to language of chunk . 27. How do I transcribe reduplicated words? . In Malay, we use reduplication for pluralising and intensifying words . | Pluralising: kakak-kakak (sisters) | Intensifying: cepat-cepat (quickly) | .

    "content": "Special thanks to Woon Fei Ting (Research Associate at BLIP) for providing the answers to the questions in this section . 28. Are we required to put a space between the individual Chinese characters in an adjective? (eg 可爱 vs 可 爱) . No space because 可爱 is a word on its own with a different meaning from the individual characters. If the voice on the recording is trying to say something/someone is “cute” then no space please. 29. It seems that there should be spacing between characters depicting quantity in Chinese (eg 一 只). Does this apply to plurality as well (eg 我 们)? . 一 and 只 should be separated because it is a number and a classifier. Classifiers have to appear for Mandarin constructions e.g. 个，条，件 and should remain separated from the number value. However, 我们 is a pronoun. This should not be separated because it is again a word on its own with a different meaning from the individual characters. 30. What is the convention when transcribing possessive markers in Chinese? (eg 他的 vs 他 的) . Like the number/classifier example above, possessive markers should be separated. 31. Is spacing needed between the characters for verbs in Chinese? (eg 看着 vs 看 着 / 长大 vs 长 大) . This one is tricky because Mandarin verbs have different forms. My idea is to separate when words do not have a different lexicalised meaning from the root verb e.g. separate for 看着， 看见，看到 - so for all these examples, the second character changes tense/usage but do not have a different lexicalised meaning that will require a separate dictionary entry BUT when we look at 看来, it does have a different lexicalised meaning from 看（i.e 看来 has its own dictionary entry separate from 看） so we do not separate the characters as it stands as a word on its own. For 长大 , I would say do not separate for the same reason as 看来 as in 长大 is a lexicalised word. But if the it is 长帅，长壮，长高 - then we should separate because the meanings of these words cannot be teased apart from the root verb 长。Also these examples will not have separate dictionary entries that is separate from root verb. I have been using this online dictionary as a guide. 32. Some Mandarin speakers may tend to shorten certain phrases, are there standardized characters for them? . These are the standardized characters to use for transcription, the actual phrase in the brackets should also be typed out in the annotation cell. Do refer to the BLIP Dictionary for transcribers for more of such examples. | 做 莫 zuo4mo4（什么） | 什莫 shen2mo4 (什么） | 酱 jiang4（这样） | 几 ji3 (e.g. 几 noisy only) | . 33. For reduplicated phrases such as 怕怕、圆圆、小小 etc., do we need to split them up in the Chunk tiers? . Reduplication is a common feature in Mandarin and when found in child-directed speech, it normally denotes diminutive forms. These should not be split up in the Chunk tiers. 2-word reduplication that are common for verbs and adjectives such as… . | 抱抱 | 怕怕 | 大大 | 小小 | 圆圆 | 短短 | 长长 | . This list is non-exhaustive. If you come across any other instances which you are unsure of, please do not hesitate to check with a full-time staff member who speaks Mandarin. As for other forms of reduplication such as 看一看、对不对、好不好 (A-X-A form), each character should be split up in the Chunk tiers as shown in the example below: . Back to table of contents . ",

    "title": "Language-Specific: Tamil",
    "content": "Special thanks to Vinitha Selvarajan (Research Assistant at BLIP) for providing the answers to the questions in this section . 34. Do I transcribe in Standard Spoken Tamil (spoken variety) or Literary Tamil (written variety)? . Always transcribe whichever Tamil variety you hear from the speaker and don’t change any spoken forms to the written variety. 35. How do I tell what variety is being used? . Native speakers tend to use the spoken variety (“Pechu Thamizh”/பேச்சு தமிழ்) in most non-formal contexts and the written variety in formal contexts. For example, Standard Spoken Tamil may be used in casual talk amongst friends and family while Literary Tamil may be used in classrooms or by newsreaders. While most native speakers can easily discern which variety is being used, knowing the context might help you make that decision as well. Do also note that speakers can switch between the varieties and the transcription should be consistent with these switches should they occur. 36. How do I transcribe Spoken Tamil? . Written Tamil has standard spelling. Most of these spelling conventions accurately represents spoken Tamil. However, sometimes these conventions are not very representative of how spoken Tamil sounds. Hence, we might spell those words differently to stay true to the phonology of the variety. We have included some spelling conventions for transcribing spoken Tamil here: . | If the word you are transcribing is a pronoun form ending with -ங்கள் in the literary variety, it should be transcribed as ending with -ங்க in spoken form. | . | Written form spelling | Spoken form spelling | . | நாங்கள் | நாங்க | . | நீங்கள் | நீங்க | . | அவர்கள் | அவங்க | . | இவர்கள் | இவங்க | . | எங்கள்* | எங்க* | . | ஆனால் (meaning: but or however) can be spelled as ஆனா in spoken form. | . | Written form spelling | Spoken form spelling | . | ஆனால் | ஆனா | . | Words about place and location of an object or the speaker such as, இங்கே, அங்கே and எங்கே should be transcribed the same way in spoken Tamil as it would be in the written variety. Even though the spoken variety of these word may sound a little different and you might want to transcribe it ending with -க instead of -கே, we will keep this spelling convention to avoid confusion. For example, if we transcribe எங்கே (written) as எங்க (spoken), it might be tokenized as the spoken variety form of the word எங்கள்* mentioned above. | . | Written form spelling | Spoken form spelling | . | இங்கே | இங்கே (remains the same) | . | அங்கே | அங்கே (remains the same) | . | எங்கே | எங்கே (remains the same) | . | Prepositions should also be transcribed the same way in spoken Tamil as it would be in the written variety. | . | Written form spelling | Spoken form spelling | . | மேலே | மேலே (remains the same) | . | கீழே | கீழே (remains the same) | . | உள்ளே | உள்ளே (remains the same) | . | வெளியே | வெளியே (remains the same) | . 37. Do I tag “ah”/ “ஆ” as Tamil or Languageless? . This depends on the context. If for example the ‘ah’ occurring in the speech is meant to show surprise like “Ah, there you are!”, then it should be tagged as Languageless. However native Tamil speakers use “ஆ” which is short for ‘ஆம்’ which means ‘yes’. So if the ‘ah/ஆ’ is being used to mean ‘yes’ or to show agreement and is being used by a native Tamil speaker, it should be tagged as Tamil. Back to table of contents . ",

    "content": "38. When do I use annotation mode and when do I use segmentation mode? . It is better to use segmentation mode for accuracy’s sake. However, one situation in which annotation mode will definitely be easier is when there is a large amount of tiers, in which there are many participants and the participants frequently switch between languages. Honestly, you can toggle between both as far as is convenient for you, but as a rule, if you have upwards of three participants, at least two of which use two or more languages and show a high amount of overlap in their speech, annotation mode will probably be easier for you. 39. What should I do with tiers that I don’t use from the template file? . Ignore them and DO NOT delete them. If you don’t need to use them, don’t annotate on them. If they are getting in your way, right click the tier panel and hide them. Back to table of contents . ",

All of these components (ID, language background, phase number, date, RID) can be taken from the .wav audio file name that you are assigned to transcribe. Ensure the components match in both the audio and transcription file name (see below for example). The transcriber ID will be the number (eg. T008) that was assigned to the person transcribing the file. The transcription version number is the transcription file version number. Important note: the date noted in the audio filenames you receive to transcribe is a placeholder. Do not worry if it does not look like an actual date, but please copy it exactly as is into the transcription file name . For example: . If you are given TTS_P11230TT_VCST_ECxxx_01_AO_20240496_v001_R003_CRR.wav to transcribe, your ELAN file name should be TTS_P11230TT_VCST_ECxxx_01_20240496_R003_T008_v0001.eaf .

These words may have originated from one of the local languages spoken in Singapore e.g., kopi originated from Malay. These words are now used widely by local speakers regardless of the speakers’ language backgrounds and it is difficult for us to classify it as belonging to one particular language. For example, when a non-Malay-speaking speaker uses the word kopi, it should be tagged as Red Dot because this speaker is not speaking in or codeswitching to Malay. This speaker is just selecting a token from their speech repertoire. However, when a Malay-speaking speaker uses kopi in a Malay utterance, it should be tagged as Malay. Red Dot words are tagged as ‘Red Dot’ in the language tier, but their Matrix language will depend on the language spoken in, before, or after the utterance with the Red Dot word. In other words, ‘Red Dot’ cannot be a Matrix tier language tag. When you see a Red Dot word, make a cell above the word and select Red Dot from the drop-down list: .

You run ELAN on your computer. Usually you can find it under your Applications folder. You go to the upper left, and click “File”. You click “New” if you want to run a new file and “Open” if you want to open an existing file. 3.1 Making a New ELAN file . On Mac: Click “New” . You will be presented with the following window. Click “Add new media file” and select the relevant sound file from your browser window. On Windows: . | Select the sound file, then click [»] to move it to ‘Selected files’. | If you have a template, select “Template” below “Media”, click [»] to move it to ‘Selected files’. | . | Press OK to continue. | . After you’ve selected your relevant file, ELAN will launch in Annotation mode, as follows. You might notice that the sound waves are not very visible in the above screen. You can make the sound waves clearer by adjusting the vertical zoom. Right click the timeline/waveform viewer, and the following menu comes up. Select the degree of zoom you want. I find that the sound waves only become clear enough at 500% zoom. This will help when you are annotating. Notice the waveforms are now clearer in the above picture ⤴ . You can also change the rate of audio playback in ELAN. The slider to alter the rate of audio playback is right above the selection control buttons. The following options are available: . | Click somewhere above or below the slider to increase or decrease the playback rate by 10%. | Move the slider up or down to increase or decrease the playback rate. | Enter the desired playback rate in the box at the left of the slider and press the key ENTER. ELAN accepts rates between 1% and 200%. | . Back to table of contents . 3.2 Saving files . Go to “File” and click “Save” or “Save As” like a normal document. ELAN generates a few files: . | *.eaf (EUDICO Annotation Format). This includes documents that were created by ELAN itself as well as documents that were imported into ELAN from Shoebox/Toolbox, CHAT or Transcriber. This file type contains all the time-aligned annotations, as well as the path to the media file(s). | *.pfsx file. This file contains user- and document- specific settings like the font size used to display text, tier order, etc. If necessary, the *.pfsx file can be safely removed as it does not contain any annotation data. | *.eafcomment. This a file with this extension is generated if you entered comments in the ELAN workspace. It is important to keep this file alongside the original *.eaf, should other transcribers need to check the comments. | *.etf. This is the file extension for ELAN template files. | *.eaf.001. This is the file extension for backup copies of your transcription file if you utilise the Automatic Backup function. (See section 3.3) | . Back to table of contents . 3.3 Automatic Backup .

This should also be done on the Translation tier if a non-English utterance is being transcribed. For example, when the baby’s name is mentioned (i.e., full name or nickname like Elizabeth or Liz respectively), transcribe it as BABYNAME. If there is mention of a pin number to an account, indicate it as CONFIDENTIAL. A full list of instances that should be redacted are included in the table below. | If a parent or child refer to the orangutan or any characters in the recording with the child’s name, the name should also be marked in the Utterance , Chunk, and Sensitive_Masking tiers for redaction. | At times, parents and their child might mention character names from shows (eg. Elsa from the Disney movie Frozen) or give names for characters that appear in the video call (eg. ah-meng the orangutan). In this case, character names need not be redacted. Their language tag in the Language tier should follow the main utterance language in which it is in, as shown in the following example: | . | When transcribing Video Call Story Time recordings from the Talk-Together Study, any mention of a participant’s Talk Together ID (also known as their Qualtrics ID) should be transcribed as CONFIDENTIAL.

For example, if the speaker said “Pedro went to NTU” but it was not clear that Pedro was the baby’s father from the context of the conversation, you should transcribe it as :n:Pedro went to NTU on the Utterance and Chunk tiers. You should also isolate and annotate the instance of Pedro as :PROTECTION-CHECK on the Sensitive_Masking tier.

You may use the following code to mark the potentially protected stretch of audio: “:PROTECTION-CHECK”. There will be weekly team meetings to discuss the contents of these protected sections.

    "content": "(Largely adapted from PDPA Guidelines for Student Organisations (NTU)) . The PDPA governs the collection, use, disclosure and care of personal data in Singapore by organizations. It recognizes both the rights of individuals to protect their personal data, including rights of access and correction, and the needs of organizations to collect, use or disclose personal data for legitimate and reasonable purposes. Every university organization, as data user who controls the collection, holding, processing, disclosure, transfer or use of personal data, must observe the personal data privacy rights of an individual. NOTE: At BLIP Lab it isn’t always aligned with the data integrity of our research to ‘correct’ data after a person has completed their participation in a study. For example, we should not alter a test score after the test has concluded, and we should not edit the text of a transcription to suit a participants’ recall of events. That said, there may be cases where a parent provides valuable contextual information that can be incorporated (e.g., the name of a pet), or a missing data (e.g., a missing page from a paper survey). Participants can always request that some portion of their data be removed from a study after the fact. However, once anonymized data have been archived in a public repository, it will not be possible to identify which participant is which. 2.1 What is Personal Data? . Personal data refers to data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified from that data; or from that data and other information to which the organization has or is likely to have access. The term “personal data” should be interpreted broadly and covers all types of data from which an individual can be identified. Examples: Full Name, Residential Address, Mobile Number, NRIC/Passport Number, Matriculation Number, Bank Account Details, Personal Image etc. 2.2 Consequences of Breaching PDPA . If the PDPC finds that an organization is in breach of any of the data protection provisions in the PDPA, it may give the organization such directions that it thinks appropriate to ensure compliance. These directions may include requiring the organization to: . | Stop collecting, using or disclosing personal data in contravention of the Act; | Destroy personal data collected in contravention of the Act; | Provide access to or correct the personal data; and/or | Pay a financial penalty of an amount not exceeding $1 million. | . There are certain situations where the breach is considered serious enough that the PDPA office of Singapore is legally obligated to be immediately notified.

    "content": "(Largely adapted from University of Leicester- Data Management Support for Researchers https://www2.le.ac.uk/services/research-data) . 3.1 Security . Whatever research data you have, whether or not it is legally defined as sensitive or confidential (with associated legal requirements over its management), you need to keep it secure and control access to it. Security encompasses the following points: . | Both electronic and physical security. | Security of both electronic and physical resources (it is wasted effort to enforce appropriate electronic security but leave physical copies of data open for others to access). | Prevention of accidental or malicious damage or modification to data. | Theft of data. | Appropriate access control to data resources – establishing boundaries around your data, defining who can and can’t access, what they can do with it. | Compliance with confidentiality, privacy and consent agreement and legislation. | Release of data before assurance of accuracy and authenticity, and the potential to void intellectual property claims. | What devices are used to store data in the short, medium and long-term. | How data is transferred between devices e.g. interviews captured on digital recorders in the field being transferred to University research data storage. | The use and security of storage devices, particularly mobile devices e.g. external hard drives and laptops, and use of appropriate encryption. | . 3.2 Confidentiality . Confidentiality can be defined in terms of “that which is intended to be kept secret”. Dealing with its implications and ethical and legal obligations is an integral part of research. Storage of data that are considered confidential or sensitive may need to be addressed during consent procedures, to inform the people to whom the data belong how and why the data will be stored. The risks of identification of personal information are typically maintained through the anonymisation of data and the regulation of access through a dedicated rights management framework. 3.2.1 How should I store confidential data? . It is important to be aware of the risks of storing personal data. Legally, data containing personal information must be treated with more care than non-identifiable data. From mid-2008 financial penalties can be enforced for the wilful circulation of personal data. Personal information can be removed from data files and stored separately under more stringent security measures. Signed consent forms or other non-digital records may contain identifying information and should be stored separately from data files, although an anonymous ID system can help link the two sets of materials together if required (e.g. for re-contacting purposes).” . The main consideration when thinking of a good storage medium are: . | Will the data be securely stored over time – will integrity be preserved? | Is its storage reliable - will data be lost? | Can the data be accessed to be used and reused? | Is it appropriate for both immediate and long-term needs? | Does storage meet relevant standards and requirements of the university, my funder, and legislation? | What is appropriate storage for sensitive, identifiable, pseudonymised and anonymised data | . With consideration to the above points, portable storage media such as CDs, DVDs and memory sticks (also known as USB sticks, flash drives, thumb drives, memory keys) present a high level of risk when being used to store research data.  They are not backed up centrally and are vulnerable to loss and damage. Portable media are also particularly vulnerable to loss, damage and degradation over time. NOTE: Therefore, in this lab, portable media devices are only for sharing of data within the lab. After sharing is completed, all data will be deleted from the portable media device. ",

No need tag on language Tier. Instead of encoding this code on the Utterance Tier, encode this on the Transcriber (Comments) Tier. | . :s:x . :s:x is a standalone token and is to be used for unclassified non-vocal sounds. Such sounds include intentional and/or relevant sounds made by parent during the recording (e.g., toy rattling, banging on table to attract the child’s attention). If there are non-intentional sounds made by baby, there is no need to mark it (e.g., baby banging on table). Other non-intentional sounds should also be ignored (e.g., water bottle dropping, chair scrapping). Do note that the sparkling sound that denotes the storybook page turning in the Talk Together Study Video Call Storytime should not be transcribed. Back to table of contents . 3.

Back to table of contents . 4. Mimicking . :m:{open class} and :m:{special code}:{open class} . :m: is for mimicking. All space between words must be replaced by “+”. Special codes include the ones listed on this wiki page e.g. v for vocal sounds, d for discourse marker, etc. Tag this in the Language Tier as whatever Language tag is applicable. This means if the individual is mimicking English words, tag it in the Language Tier as English, but if the individual is mimicking nonsense syllables, tag is as “Vocal Sounds”. | Description | Marking | Tag on Language Tier | . | Parent Mimicking Child vocalization | :m:banana | Relevant Language. “Vocal Sounds” if nonsense syllables | . | Parent mimicking child singing | :m:si:rain+rain+go+away | Relevant language. “Vocal Sounds” if nonsense syllables | . | Parent mimicking use of discourse marker | :m:d:lah | Red-dot | .

Back to table of contents . 5. Loanwords . :l:langname:{open class} . This is for Loanwords. If a word is borrowed into a different language from the main utterance language, it should be separated in the Chunk tiers and tagged accordingly. Below is an example where ummi is an Arabic term but was borrowed into Malay. If one is unsure of what the loanword is and/or unsure of what language it should be tagged in, #!#? should be annotated in the Utterance, Chunk and Language tiers. For more strange loanwords such as “sabo” just put it as a loanword from English. Back to table of contents . 6. Bound Morphemes . ={open} . This is for Bound Morphemes. Bound Morphemes . Bound morphemes are classed as =BoundMorpheme. So if the Bound morpheme is =le, it will be Mainword =le. If the bound morpheme comes from a different language, tag the language accordingly. Here are more examples of bound morphemes: . Bound morphemes that occur at start of word will still be tagged with = . Back to table of contents . 7. Unclear or unknown language . #!#langname and #!#? . Unclear language will be noted as #!#langname in the Language tier, #!#Bahasa for example. Completely unknown language will be noted as #!#? in the Language tier. Back to table of contents . 8. Special Cases . Special cases will be addressed here as and when they pop up. In the case of a person singing an animal sound, class it as Singing then type in the words. Because the Singing class is an open class category.

    "content": "1. Punctuation and capitalisation in annotations are not necessary . Utterances do not need capitalisation and punctuation when transcribed. There are a few exceptions that we allow. These include: . | Censoring personal information (e.g., BABYNAME, CONFIDENTIAL) See Privacy Matters for more information. | Question marks (?) e.g., what is that? | Ellipsis to indicate stuttering/interrupted speech (…) e.g. She told me that she t… took the taxi. | Ellipsis can also be used to indicate a parent prompting children on words e.g., Mum: a pink um... Child: brella | . | Tildes (~) to indicate long languageless words (e.g., oh~) . | In our recordings, words may be dragged out longer than usual as the recordings are usually child-directed. There is no need to label such instances with tildes. Thus, tildes should only be used for languageless words. | . | Colons/equal/plus signs used within the special coding conventions e.g., :v:laughing (see List of Special Codes section of the wiki) | Three pound signs (###) to indicate unintelligible/inaudible speech. | Do note that ### is a standalone token and should not be with anything else, e.g. :m:### or :si:###. | . | Apostrophes (‘) in contractions e.g., can’t, don’t, shouldn’t | Hyphens (-) for word connecting forms e.g., jalan-jalan | . 2. Don’t delete unused tiers in the template. Right click on the tier panel and hide them if they are getting in your way . 3. Adjust the horizontal and vertical zooms for more accurate transcription . Adjust the vertical zoom (right click on the waveform &gt; Vertical Zoom &gt; adjust the %) and horizontal zoom (adjust the slider at the bottom right of the ELAN screen) to help you see the waveform clearly. 4. Edit the tier attributes after you import the template . Edit the tier attributes to replace placeholder participant codes with accurate participant ID codes for all the participants present in the recording. This should be done on all the present participant’s primary and secondary tiers.(e.g. the participant ID is P1234TT and the mother, baby, and researcher (R099) are present in this recording. The Mother code MPXXXXTT should be edited to MP1234TT on all the Mother primary and secondary tiers (Utterance, Language, Chunk, Target EL/CL/ML/TL, Translation, Matrix, Sensitive_Masking). The Baby code PXXXXTT should be edited to P1234TT on all the Baby primary and secondary tiers. The Researcher code R00XPxxxxTT should be edited to R099P1234TT on all the Researcher primary and secondary tiers). 5. Ensure the Utterance, Chunk, and Language tiers are annotated. The Translation tier and Sensitive_Masking tier should also be annotated when applicable. Unless otherwise instructed, the Utterance, Chunk, and Language tiers should always have annotated cells. You will also have to translate the utterance on the Translation tier if you are transcribing non-English utterances. The translation can be a loose translation i.e., enough information for an outside English reader to understand what is going on. Isolate instances (e.g., mention of the baby’s name) that need redacting on the Sensitive_Masking tier. Live demo on how to use the Sensitive_Masking tier here. 6. Mark inaudible segments with three pound signs (###) . Transcribe inaudible/unintelligible segments as ### in the Utterance and Chunk tiers, then tag it as “Vocal Sounds” in the Language tier. 7. Transcribing a Chinese recording? Ensure you put spaces between Chinese words in the Chunk tier . Refer to What is a word? By Dr. Shamala Sundaray. Please put spaces in between Chinese words in the Chunk tier but not the Utterance tier. Questions regarding this have been answered in the Frequently Asked Questions by our Research Associate Woon Fei Ting. However, for the Utterance tier, spaces should be placed to separate Chinese characters from text that aren’t Chinese characters. e.g., “she eats 那个 uh 大大的汉堡包 :v:laughter” (Translation: She eats that uh huge hamburger :v:laughter) should be written in the Utterance tier as she eats 那个 uh 大大的汉堡包 :v:laughter and NOT as she eats那个uh大大的汉堡包:v:laughter The exception to this rule is question marks e.g. orangutan is sad 对不对? (Translation: orangutan is sad, isn’t it?)is correct. 8. Keyboard shortcuts are your friend! . ELAN keyboard shortcuts can help streamline your transcription process. Here are a few: . | Description | Shortcut Key and Notes | . | Create a new annotation cell | alt + N or ctrl + alt + N (Windows) or option + N (Mac) | . | Modify annotatiion cell time | With a selected cell (it’ll be blue if it’s selected) &gt; click and drag to desired timepoints so that the area is highlighted &gt; ctrl + enter (Windows) or command + enter (Mac) | . | Play/pause media file | shift + space | . | Play a selected cell | shift + space | . | Move to previous cell | alt + left arrow key | . | Move to next cell | alt + right arrow key | . 9.

Utterance Tier . Video guide to utterance tier here . Purpose: This tier will transcribe all utterances in terms of what is being said. It will be a single tier with no sub-divisions. Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] (Utterance)”. The complete name should look like Mother (Utterance). Parent (primary) tier: none . Tier Type: Utterance (i.e., no stereotype, no use of controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Chunk Tier . Video guide to chunk tier here. Live demo video on how to sub-divide cells on the chunk tier here. Purpose: This tier will transcribe all utterances in terms of what is being said, but cells can be subdivided should there be instances of interjections, vocal sounds, non-vocal sounds, or code-switching. Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] (Chunk)”. The complete name should look like Mother (Chunk). Parent (primary tier): “[person_name] (Utterance)” . Tier Type: Chunk_TimeSub (Time Subdivision stereotype, no use of controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Language Tier . Video guide on the language tier here. Purpose: This tier is for transcribing utterances in terms of what fine-grained language is spoken. For example, let us look at the sentence “他喜欢吃 hamburger” (translation: he likes to eat hamburgers). “他喜欢吃” (translation: he likes to eat) will be labelled as ‘Mandarin’ but “hamburger” will be labelled as English. This tier differs from the Matrix tier (see Matrix Tier sub-section). Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] (Language)”. The complete name should look like Mother (Language). Parent (primary) tier: “[person_name] (Chunk)” . Tier Type: Lang_TimeSub (Time Subdivision sterotype, Languages controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Target_EL Tier . Video guide on all target language tiers here. Purpose: EL stands for ‘English’. This tier is for transcribing ‘target’ English words from the Picture Cards (Vowel Triangle) activity. The four (4) target English words can be found here. These are included in a controlled vocabulary assigned to the tier type of any adult Target_EL tier. However, the tier type for Baby (Target_EL) does not have a controlled vocabulary, so as to allow the transcriber to freely transcribe any instance of the baby’s attempt at vocalising a target word (e.g., if a baby says ‘pwee’ instead of ‘pea’). Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] Target_EL”. The complete name should look like Mother (Target_EL). Parent (primary tier): “[person_name] (Chunk)” . Tier Type for adult tiers: Target_Words_Eng_IncIn (Included in stereotype, Target_Words_Eng controlled vocabulary) . Tier Type for baby tiers: Baby_Target_Words_IncIn (Included in stereotype, no controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Target_CL Tier . Video guide on all target language tiers here. Purpose: CL stands for ‘Mandarin’. This tier is for transcribing ‘target’ Mandarin words from the Picture Cards (Vowel Triangle) and Green Grass Park Voicemail Game activity. These are included in a controlled vocabulary assigned to the tier type of any adult Target_CL tier. However, the tier type for Baby (Target_CL) does not have a controlled vocabulary, so as to allow the transcriber to freely transcribe any instance of the baby’s attempt at vocalising a target word. The eleven (11) target Mandarin words for the Picture Cards activity can be found here. The target Mandarin words for the Green Grass Park Voicemail Game activity can be found here (click to enlarge picture). Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] Target_CL”. The complete name should look like Mother (Target_CL). Parent (primary tier): “[person_name] (Chunk)” .

Tier Type for baby tiers: Baby_Target_Words_IncIn (Included in stereotype, no controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Target_ML Tier . Video guide on all target language tiers here. Purpose: ML stands for ‘Malay’. This tier is for transcribing ‘target’ Malay words from the Picture Cards (Vowel Triangle) and Green Grass Park Voicemail Game activity. These are included in a controlled vocabulary assigned to the tier type of any adult Target_ML tier. However, the tier type for Baby (Target_ML) does not have a controlled vocabulary, so as to allow the transcriber to freely transcribe any instance of the baby’s attempt at vocalising a target word. The four (4) target Malay words for the Picture Cards activity can be found here. The target Malay words for the Green Grass Park Voicemail Game activity can be found here (click to enlarge picture). Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] Target_ML”. The complete name should look like Mother (Target_ML). Parent (primary tier): “[person_name] (Chunk)” .

Tier Type for baby tiers: Baby_Target_Words_IncIn (Included in stereotype, no controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Target_TL Tier . Video guide on all target language tiers here. Purpose: TL stands for ‘Tamil’. This tier is for transcribing ‘target’ Tamil words from the Picture Cards (Vowel Triangle) and Green Grass Park Voicemail Game activity. Unlike the other Target tiers, there is temporarily no controlled vocabulary for the Tamil target words. This is because the ELAN software does not have the functionality (yet) to input Tamil script into the controlled vocabulary window. In the meantime, all Tamil target words must be inputted directly (i.e., typed) on the tiers. The tier type for Baby (Target_TL) also does not have a controlled vocabulary, so as to allow the transcriber to freely transcribe any instance of the baby’s attempt at vocalising a target word. The four (4) target Tamil words for the Picture Cards activity can be found here. The target Tamil words for the Green Grass Park Voicemail Game activity can be found here (click to enlarge picture) . Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] Target_TL”. The complete name should look like Mother (Target_TL). Parent (primary tier): “[person_name] (Chunk)” . Tier Type for adult tiers: Target_Words_Tamil_IncIn (Included in stereotype, no controlled vocabulary) . Tier Type for baby tiers: Baby_Target_Words_IncIn (Included in stereotype, no controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Translation Tier . Video guide to translation tier here. Purpose: This tier will contain English translations of non-English utterances. A loose translation of the utterance will suffice i.e., enough information for an outside English reader to understand what is going on. A person who reads the translation tier will be someone who does not speak the language. Translate the utterance into English as if you were trying to explain it to someone who does not speak the language. Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] (Translation)”. The complete name should look like Mother (Translation). Parent (primary) tier: “[person_name] (Utterance)” . Tier Type: Translation (Symbolic Association stereotype, no use of controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Matrix Tier . Video guide on matrix tier here. THIS TIER CAN CURRENTLY BE IGNORED AND NOT BE USED. HOWEVER, DO NOT DELETE IT! . Purpose: In contrast to the Language tier that focuses on the fine-grained language spoken in the utterance, the Matrix tier focuses on transcribing the language that encapsulates the utterance. While both Mandarin and English are spoken in the sentence “他喜欢吃 hamburger” (Translation: He likes to eat hamburgers), the Matrix language will be Mandarin. This is because “hamburger” (English) is embedded into the utterance’s Mandarin sentence structure. The name of this tier was inspired by the concepts of matrix clauses and subordinate clauses. For an easy-to-understand explanation of these concepts, please read this post from AllThingsLinguistic. Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] (Matrix)”. The complete name should look like Mother (Matrix). Parent (primary) tier: “[person_name] (Utterance)” . Tier Type: Matrix_Lang (Symbolic Association stereotype, Matrix_Languages controlled vocabulary) . Back to table of contents . Sensitive_Masking Tier . Video guide on Sensitive_Masking here. Live demo on how to use the Sensitive_Masking tier here. Purpose: This tier is for isolating and annotating instances in the audio file that needs redaction. It is assigned a controlled vocabulary of redaction codes that the transcriber can choose from. Annotating instances on this tier means that it will be essentially “censored” with a beep when the audio recording is released to the public (like songs that contain expletives or when someone says a swear word on television). Instances that should be redacted include: . | Instance | Redaction Code | . | Baby’s name | BABYNAME | . | Baby’s sibling’s name | SIBLINGNAME | . | An adult’s name | ADULTNAME | . | Baby’s father’s name | FATHERNAME | . | Baby’s mothers’s name | MOTHERNAME | . | Baby’s grandmother’s name | GRANDMOTHERNAME | . | Baby’s grandfather’s name | GRANDFATHERNAME | . | A stranger’s name (e.g., classmate, co-worker) | STRANGERNAME | . | Pins, passwords, personal discussions, study IDs | CONFIDENTIAL | . | Candidate for redaction and to alert supervisor/second transcriber to check | :PROTECTION-CHECK | . Things to note: . | Names of individuals on the research team do not need to be redacted. | Any mention of the baby’s name must always be redacted as BABYNAME on the Utterance, Chunk, and Sensitive_Masking tier. | If it is ever unclear as to who the name belongs to, transcribe the name on the Utterance and Chunk tiers (also the Translation tier, if applicable) as :n:[attempt at spelling the name]. For example, if the speaker said “Jillian went to the supermarket” but it was not clear that Jillian was the baby’s grandmother from the context of the conversation, you should transcribe it as :n:Jillian went to the supermarket on the Utterance and Chunk tiers. You should also isolate and annotate the instance of Jillian as :PROTECTION-CHECK on the Sensitive_Masking tier. Using this convention will alert the transcript checker (i.e., a full-time staff member) to match it to a list of possible caregiver names that we have on record, and annotate it with the corresponding redaction code accordingly on the Sensitive_Masking tier. | . For more information on how to handle privacy matters during transcription, please read the privacy matters section of the wiki. Naming: Tag the tier “[person_name] (Sensitive_Masking)”.

For instance, the parent may follow up an utterance to the child with a directive to the researcher, e.g., look at the monkey okay next page what is this. A part of the utterance is instructions directed to the researcher to flip the page during the storybook sharing task. Hence, it should be transcribed as separate utterances: look at the monkey, okay next page, what is this. In general, utterances directed to two different people should be considered as separate utterances. In some cases, prosodic information in the audio file may offer additional information on how to segment the utterance. | . | Decide how to transcribe speech unrelated to storybook reading. | There is a difference in transcription protocols and conventions when transcribing utterances related or unrelated to the storybook reading. | As a general rule of thumb, we wish to transcribe speech that is observed during the story reading segment to understand how parents engage their children in a shared storybook reading exercise. During the story reading segment, there may be speech that is not related to the storybook reading. Examples: . | questions or instructions to researchers (e.g., is the page supposed to turn?, next page), | requests to pause the task (e.g., sorry can we pause?), | talks to another person (e.g., Mother turning around to talk to Father that came into the room) | . | For the above scenarios, if the parent remains on screen and does not start a completely new task, speech should be transcribed as per normal. | On the other hand, if the parent leaves the screen or starts a completely new task unrelated to story reading, we will partially transcribe the speech as outlined in Step 9 below. | In order to decide which conventions should be used, this decision table should be used. If you are still unsure, please check in with any team members for further clarification. | . | Partially transcribe speech unrelated to storybook reading. | For the portions before the start and after the end of story reading segment of the audio file, if any speaker is talking, mark the onsets and offsets of each utterance. | As we only wish to transcribe speech during story reading segment, utterances that occur before the start of story reading and utterances that occur after the end of story reading should be labelled but do not need to be fully transcribed. | If the utterance only contains speech and vocal sounds, demarcate the onset and offset of the utterance. Type *untranscribed_speech* (with the asterisks) in the Utterance and Chunk tiers. Then, use the Vocal Sounds tag in the Language tier. There is no need to demarcate the onsets and offsets of different languages or vocal sounds for each utterance. If the Baby makes noises/speaks, follow the same procedure in the Utterance and Chunk tiers, and the Language tag is Vocal Sounds as well. This is the only time Vocal Sounds can be used in the Baby (Language) tier. | . | If the utterance only contains non-vocal sounds, it should be labelled with the appropriate tags. Example, if there is clapping, :s:clapping should be enclosed in the Utterance and Chunk tiers, while Non Vocal Sounds should be used in the Language tier. Note that the chime sound that plays when the orangutan storybook pages turn should not be transcribed. Mouse clicks should not be transcribed either. Read our section on non-vocal sounds here should you need additional guidance on what non-vocal sounds should be labelled. | . | If the utterance contains both non-vocal sounds and speech, the onset and offset of speech and non vocal sounds should be demarcated accordingly. If the chime sound that plays when the orangutan storybook pages turn or mouse clicking sounds happen in between untranscribed speech, there is no need to demarcate them. | If you hear names or items to be redacted, isolate these instances the in SENSITIVE_MASKING tiers. Refer to this site to see what should be redacted. | If more than one Sensitive_Masking tag appears in an utterance, they should be added by order of which they appear. For example, if the Mother says the sibling’s name followed by some words and then the baby’s name, you should transcribe it as: *untranscribed_speech* SIBLINGNAME BABYNAME in the Utterance and Chunk tier. Then isolate the instances of each name in the SENSITIVE_MASKING tier of the Mother. | . | . | IMPORTANT: If you are unsure whether to redact an audio region, please consult the team for a second opinion. It’s important for us to ascertain carefully if an audio region should be redacted or not to protect the privacy of our participants. | . NOTE: We recommend future researchers to do Steps 8 and 9 while transcribing the audio file. These steps were done post-hoc when transcribing the Talk Together Study audio files and added into the transcription protocol after. Since July 2023, these steps have been fully integrated into the BLIP lab’s transcription workflow (see Talk-a-thon VCST protocol). | Ensure you mark out the start and end of the story reading segment in the recording on the ActivityMarkers tier. Follow the guidelines in step 1 to get an understanding of where each activity starts and ends. Do consult a full-time staff member should you have any questions. | :marker:start:cds_book should be used to mark the start of the Story Reading segment. | :marker:end:cds_book should be used to mark the end of the Story Reading Segment. | Watch our video here or the read the activity markers section in our tier guide in this wiki should you need more guidance on how the ActivityMarkers tier works. | . | Update the transcription log to note your transcription progress on a given file. a) If you’re still working on the file, note “ongoing” in Column J (actual trans. hrs) and add the date and amount of audio transcribed in the 1st or 2nd listen column (Column K and L, respectively). b) If you have finished transcribing a file alert a full-time staff member, update Column J (actual trans. hrs) with the number of hours it took you to complete the transcription, and write the dates of completion of each listen in Column K and L.

Type *untranscribed_speech* (with the asterisks) in the Utterance and Chunk tiers. Then, use the Vocal Sounds tag in the Language tier. There is no need to demarcate the onsets and offsets of different languages or vocal sounds for each utterance. If the Baby makes noises/speaks, follow the same procedure in the Utterance and Chunk tiers, and the Language tag is Vocal Sounds as well. This is the only time Vocal Sounds can be used in the Baby (Language) tier. | . | If the utterance only contains non-vocal sounds, it should be labelled with the appropriate tags. Example, if there is clapping, :s:clapping should be enclosed in the Utterance and Chunk tiers, while Non Vocal Sounds should be used in the Language tier. Note that the chime sound that plays when the orangutan storybook pages turn should not be transcribed. Mouse clicks should not be transcribed either. Read our section on non-vocal sounds here should you need additional guidance on what non-vocal sounds should be labelled. | . | If the utterance contains both non-vocal sounds and speech, the onset and offset of speech and non vocal sounds should be demarcated accordingly. If the chime sound that plays when the orangutan storybook pages turn or mouse clicking sounds happen in between untranscribed speech, there is no need to demarcate them. | If you hear names or items to be redacted, isolate these instances the in SENSITIVE_MASKING tiers. Refer to this site to see what should be redacted. | If more than one Sensitive_masking tag appears in an utterance, they should be added by order of which they appear. For example, if the Mother says the sibling’s name followed by some words and then the baby’s name, you should transcribe it as: *untranscribed_speech* SIBLINGNAME BABYNAME in the Utterance and Chunk tier. Then isolate the instances of each name in the SENSITIVE_MASKING tier of the Mother. | . | IMPORTANT: If you are unsure whether to redact an audio region, please consult the team for a second opinion. It’s important for us to ascertain carefully if an audio region should be redacted or not to protect the privacy of our participants. | . NOTE: We recommend future researchers to do Steps 8 and 9 while transcribing the audio file. These steps were done post-hoc when transcribing the Talk Together Study audio files and added into the protocol after.

    "content": "The Video Call Storytime (VCST) activity in the Talk Together Study is a recording of an interaction between a parent and child over a video call (Zoom). The Phase/Timepoint 3 VCST recordings includes: . | The parent reading the picture cards/vowel triangle cards to their child in English and their preferred language (Mandarin, Malay, or Tamil). As per protocol change on 15th November 2021, the Picture Cards activity will now be fully transcribed. See point 7(a) below for more details. | The parent reading “The Little Orangutan: What a Scary Storm” book to their child | . The VCST will usually include one Parent (Father or Mother), one Baby, and one Researcher. There may be instances where another person’s voice may appear in the recording (e.g., a sibling of the baby, another family member, etc.) . | Watch the VIDEO recording file in full before you begin transcribing. | Familiarize yourself with the participants’ voices and any contextual information. | Note how many participants there are. Identify the participant by their relationship to the baby. | Note what languages are being spoken. | Note down the timepoints when the Picture Cards (PC) segment starts and ends for ActivityMarker purposes . | The start of the PC segment is the very start of the recording, including researcher instruction/speech | The end of the PC segment is usually when the researcher says something along the lines of “That was great! Thank you so much” (indicating that the parents has read through all the necessary cards), or if the parent says something along the lines of “Next. I’m ready to move on to the next activity”. | . | Note down the timepoints when the story reading segment starts and ends for ActivityMarker purposes . | The start of the story segment is when the researcher says something along the lines of “I will now switch off my camera. Just remember, once you are ready to go to the next page, you can tell me ‘Next!’ Are you ready? Okay let’s begin”. Ensure you include this researcher instruction/speech within the starting marker. | The end of the story segment is usually when the parent/child says ‘the end’ or finish recapping the story or finish talking about the orangutan holding pencils on the last page of the book. The ending marker should be placed right before the researcher comes back into the recording and says something along the lines of “Thank you! You and your child looked like you were having so much fun….” If you’re unsure, ask a full-time staff member. | . | Note any muffled parts or parts where all speech become indecipherable. Information on how to deal with these parts can be found under Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). | . | Import the associated AUDIO (.wav) file and the template file (.etf) into ELAN. Refer to the “Transcription Template” section of the wiki on instructions on how to handle the template subsequent to importing it. | a) Go to “File” and click “Save” or “Save As” like a normal document. The file should be named according to the file naming conventions outlined on the wiki. You can also set an automatic backup of the file by going to “File” &gt; “Automatic Backup”. Choose a time interval between 1 to 30 minutes that suits your preference. Note: the backup file will be saved with the extension *.eaf.001. b) Update the transcription log - namely AudioFileName (Column B), TranscribedFileName (Column C), Project (Column D, in this case would be TTS), Audio Length (Column E), Language(s) spoken in the recording (Column G), Transcriber 1 (Column H, which would be your name), Date issued (Column I). It will also help to write down anything of note (e.g., audio dropping at any point, the length of an activity) into the Comments by Transcriber (Column M). | In order to see the hierarchical relationship between the dependent tiers, right click on the tier sidebar &gt; Sort Tiers &gt; Sort by Hierarchy. | Edit the tier attributes to replace placeholder participant codes with accurate participant ID codes for all the participants present in the recording. This should be done on all the present participant’s primary and secondary tiers.(e.g. the participant ID is P1234TT and the mother, baby, and researcher (R099) are present in this recording. The Mother code MPXXXXTT should be edited to MP1234TT on all the Mother primary and secondary tiers. The Baby code PXXXXTT should be edited to P1234TT on all the Baby primary and secondary tiers. The Researcher code R00XPxxxxTT should be edited to R099P1234TT on all the Researcher primary and secondary tiers). DO NOT DELETE UNUSED TIERS. Right click on the tier panel and hide them if they are getting in your way . | Adjust the vertical zoom (right click on the waveform &gt; Vertical Zoom &gt; adjust the %) and horizontal zoom (adjust the slider at the bottom right of the ELAN screen) to help you see the waveform clearly. | Put on your headphones and begin transcribing the PC segment (a) and story reading segment (b) of the audio file. 7a. Transcribing the PC segment . | For the picture cards segment during the timepoint 3 video call story time, transcribers need to also can isolate the target words spoken by the parent or child on the participants’ respective Target word tiers (e.g., Target_EL for target English words). Please see the two images above as examples. | Target word tiers for the baby do not have a controlled vocabulary assigned to them. Transcribers can freely transcribe any instance of the baby’s attempt at vocalising a target word (e.g., if a baby says ‘pa’ instead of ‘pea’). | The picture card activity is looking to elicit the following sounds: . | xi (for Mandarin Picture Cards) | si (for Mandarin Picture Cards) | pi (for English, Mandarin, Tamil, Malay Picture Cards) | pa (for English, Mandarin, Tamil, Malay Picture Cards) | pu (for English, Mandarin, Tamil, Malay Picture Cards) | . | For incomplete target words, it is necessary to isolate them in the target word tiers if the target sounds are elicited. See the images below as examples. | . Example: in ‘西瓜’ if parent says ‘西’, we should tag it in the Target_CL tier. However, if only ‘瓜’ is said, it is not necessary to label it in the Target_CL tier. This would apply to English, Malay and Tamil as well, whereby in Malay if ‘pa’ was said, it should be indicated in the Target_ML tier but there is no need to do so for ‘dang’. . | At times, parents might say the plural versions of the target words (e.g. peas, partners). In this case, it is still necessary to isolate them in the target word tiers as the target sounds were elicited. | . | If target words are spelt out letter by letter i.e. parent says each letter out loud, they do not need to be tagged in the target word tiers. When a word is being said out letter by letter, it should be annotated like this: p... e... a... Do refer to the example as shown below. | . | Isolate instances (e.g., mention of the baby’s name) that need redacting on the Sensitive_Masking tier. Live demo on how to use the Sensitive_Masking tier here. | Use the Translation tier if you need to translate any non-English utterances into English. | . 7b. Transcribing the story reading segment . | Transcribe utterances on the Utterance, Chunk, and Language tiers. Use the Translation tier if you need to translate any non-English utterances into English. | Isolate instances (e.g., mention of the baby’s name) that need redacting on the Sensitive_Masking tier. Live demo on how to use the Sensitive_Masking tier here. | What counts as an utterance? Read “A Problem Named Utterance” by Dr. Shamala Sundaray, which can be found here | Utterances directed to the child and researcher should be separate. For instance, the parent may follow up an utterance to the child with a directive to the researcher, e.g., look at the monkey okay next page what is this. A part of the utterance is instructions directed to the researcher to flip the page during the storybook sharing task. Hence, it should be transcribed as separate utterances: look at the monkey, okay next page, what is this. In general, utterances directed to two different people should be considered as separate utterances. In some cases, prosodic information in the audio file may offer additional information on how to segment the utterance. | . | Decide how to transcribe speech unrelated to storybook reading and unrelated to PC segments. | There is a difference in transcription protocols and conventions when transcribing utterances related or unrelated to the activities in the audio recording (in this case, storybook reading and PC segments). | As a general rule of thumb, we wish to transcribe speech that is observed during the story reading and PC segments to understand how parents engage their children in these shared activities. During these activities, there may be speech that is not related to the activities. Examples: . | questions or instructions to researchers (e.g., is the page supposed to turn?, next page), | requests to pause the task (e.g., sorry can we pause?), | talks to another person (e.g., Mother turning around to talk to Father that came into the room) | . | For the above scenarios, if the parent remains on screen and does not start a completely new task, speech should be transcribed as per normal. | On the other hand, if the parent leaves the screen or starts a completely new task unrelated to story reading or PC, we will partially transcribe the speech as outlined in Step 9 below. | In order to decide which conventions should be used, this decision table should be used.

At the end of each day (if transcribing was done), key in the date and amount of audio transcribed e.g., 19/04/2021 3m 40s. Once done with the transcription, enter the date completed. | 2nd listen: This refers to Transcriber 1’s own check of the fully completed transcription (1st listen). Think of it like how you proof-read an essay after you are done writing it. | Comments by transcriber: Enter any comments you have regarding the file (e.g., ambiguities, difficulties due to audio issues, other relevant notes such as the length of an activity during the recording) | Checker/transcriber 2: This will be filled in by the person who checks the transcription. Checker has to verify transcription against the audio, looking for misalignment, inaccurate annotations, typos, etc. Click here for a full overview on the checker’s role. | Date issued: This will be filled in by the checker. They will enter when they were issued the filed to check. | Completion: This will be filled in by the checker. They will enter when they completed checking the file. | Comments by checker: This will be filled in by the checker. They will enter any amendments they had to make and include any other comments. | TranscribedFileName: This will be filled in by the checker. They will enter the filename of the completed checked file. | Supervisor’s comment: This will be filled in by the supervisor. They will enter any comments they have regarding a file. | Comments from first processing: Notes/errors that arose during the processing script run on the checked transcript (i.e., aspects that neeed to be fixed even after it was submitted for processing subsequent to being checked) | Editor/fixer: The initials of the transcriber who edited/fixed the transcript based on the errors found from the first processing | Date of editing: Date that the checked transcript was edited | Comments from editing: Comments by editor, including what was edited or fixed. | Filename post-editing: The filename of the transcription file after fixing any errors that arose during processing. | .

It is the lab’s resource of words/phrases encountered during the transcription process that may or may not have caused problems for the transcriber. Problems may include common spelling differences (e.g., biryani vs biriyani), Red Dot words, etc. It is organised by language: English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil, Red Dot words, Common Interjections. Any words or phrases that you have difficulty with handling (i.e., with spelling or knowing what language to classify it as) should be flagged to your supervisor.

Back to table of contents . Tasks to complete PRIOR to beginning to transcribe using the template file: . 1. Check the README (if available) for contextual information (e.g., which participants are present, what languages are spoken, etc.) . 2. Edit the tiers to replace placeholders with accurate participant ID codes for all participants (See “A Guide To All Your Tiers” for full list of participant codes) . Go to Tier &gt; Change Tier Attributes &gt; Edit the “Participant” line (e.g., if the baby has a Child ID of P1234TT, their participant line for all of their tiers should be changed from PxxxTT to P1234TT. Similarly, the baby’s mother’s participant line should be changed from MPxxxTT to MP1234TT. In the case of the researcher, edit their “Tier name” and “Participant line” to reflect their researcher code. For example, if the researcher who worked with P1234TT has a researcher code of R111, their tier name should be renamed from R00X to R111, and their participant line should be changed from R00XPxxxxT to R111P1234TT. 3. Generate any new participant tiers if necessary (e.g., if theres more than one Unknown individual). * See [Transcribing Dependent Tiers](/belacon/archive/2.0.0a21ELAN/fundamentals/transcribing-dependent-tiers.html), with instructions on how to create new dependent tiers * See [A Guide to All Your Tiers](/belacon/archive/2.0.0a21ELAN/protocols/tier-guide.html) for the tier type stereotypes and hierarchical relationships of each tier needed.
