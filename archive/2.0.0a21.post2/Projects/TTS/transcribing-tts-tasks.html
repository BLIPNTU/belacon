The first activity of the Voicemail Game is the Picture Cards activity. We may also refer to this as the Vowel Triangle activity.</p> <p>The picture cards include a picture and an associated “target” word. Participants will read the individual words one-by-one in English and their other preferred language language. The recording should only contain one adult speaker.</p> <p>Visit <a href="https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/blip/baby/talktogetherstudy/audio/picturecards/">this page</a> to see all the picture cards sorted by language.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Import the audio file (.wav) <em>and</em> the template file (.etf) into ELAN.

The file should be named according to the file naming conventions outlined on the wiki. You can also set an automatic backup of the file by going to “File” &gt; “Automatic Backup”. Choose a time interval between 1 to 30 minutes that suits your preference.

Information on how to deal with these parts can be found under Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).</p> </li> <li> <p>Edit the tier attributes to replace placeholder participant codes with accurate participant ID codes for all the participants present in the recording.
